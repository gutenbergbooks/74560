<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late autumn in the north woods, and Beatrice
and Josephine were thinking about Christmas. They
liked to think about Christmas: they liked to talk
about it and to sing Christmas songs and to play
Christmas games. Those two little girls had been
known to play the game of Santa Claus filling Christmas
stockings on the Fourth of July; and it was
such fun they did not care who laughed.</p>

<p>Beatrice was seven years old and Josephine was
nine that particular autumn day when they climbed
to the top of the front gate posts to talk it over.
There was no gate in front of their log cabin, only
an opening where a gate would some day swing on
hinges and fasten with a click. The gate posts were
made of big, round logs of cedar, and were almost
two feet taller than the top of the fence. There was
a path leading from the gateway to the front door
of the log cabin, and behind the cabin, and surrounding
it on three sides, were the evergreen
woods. In front of the cabin was a wide clearing belonging
to the railway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>From early spring until late in the autumn the
little girls were in the habit of climbing on the gate
posts to watch the trains go by.</p>

<p>“I suppose if we had lots of money,” said Beatrice
from the top of her gate post, “I suppose
we could go to Marquette and buy Christmas presents
for the whole family!”</p>

<p>“But most of all for mother!” added Josephine,
happily kicking her feet.</p>

<p>“What should we get mother if we had money and
could go traveling?” Beatrice inquired.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Josephine, “if we ever have a
ride on the cars, and if we ever go to Marquette with
father and our pockets full of money, we’d buy,—we’d
buy,—I don’t know what and you don’t know
what!”</p>

<p>At that, the two little girls laughed and laughed
until they almost fell off the gate posts; they liked
to sit on the gate posts and laugh. For a while they
talked about the Christmas presents they should
like to make.</p>

<p>“But there should be something special for our
mother,” insisted Josephine.</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered Beatrice, as she happily kicked
her feet against her gate post, “I guess we’ll have
to give mother the same old promise we give her
every Christmas, that she will have all the year two
little girls, oh, such good little girls, to help take
care of babies and tidy up the cabin, tra la-la, tra
la-la-la!”</p>

<p>After that, until the afternoon train whistled, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
merry little girls kept choosing gifts for all the family,
but most of all for mother. But the minute the
train whistled, Beatrice suggested a new game.</p>

<p>“When the train starts puff-puff from the station
just round the curve over there,” said she, “and the
wheels begin to turn round slowly, and the cars come
slowly, rumble-rumble, you turn square round facing
the train this way, just like me, and you sing
with me this song I am just thinking up, and we’ll
try Christmas magic, like this:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“White magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christmas magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Send our mother a Christmas gift!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Christmas magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Send our mother a Christmas gift!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>By the time the passenger train was opposite the
little log cabin, the laughing children were gazing
straight toward it, singing over and over to the
rumble of the wheels:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“White magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christmas magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Send our mother a Christmas gift!</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gold magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christmas magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Send our mother a Christmas gift!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of course those two little girls away off in the
upper peninsula of Michigan, miles and miles from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
any town, did not expect a magic Christmas gift
for their mother; they simply had a good time, and
forgot all about their game as soon as it was over
and they had climbed down from their gate posts to
go to the pasture after the cows.</p>

<p>But the day before Christmas, when the little
cabin was bursting with Christmas joy and secrets,
the postmaster from the settlement called to see
Beatrice and Josephine.... He said he wished to
speak with them alone. There was only one room in
the cabin, one big, clean, cheerful room, and so the
little girls climbed into the postmaster’s sleigh and
drove with him beyond sight of the house. Then he
said “Whoa!” to his horses, and without another
word he untied a big, flat parcel that looked like
a picture in a frame; and it was a picture in a frame— a
big picture of two merry-looking little girls, each
seated on a gate post in front of a log-cabin home
that had evergreen woods behind it and a clearing
in front.</p>

<p>It was a long time before either child could speak;
then Josephine whispered, “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“A lady on a passing train who is a stranger to
us all,” the postmaster answered, “took a snapshot
of you two, because you looked so happy. Then she
had the picture enlarged and framed and sent it to
me to give to you, so that you might give it to your
mother for Christmas. She said she was sure I would
know who you were by the picture; so, as I thought
you would like a big Christmas surprise for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
mother, I asked to see you alone. Now we’ll drive
back to the house.”</p>

<p>At last Beatrice found her voice; but “Did you
ever!” was all she said, and “Did you ever!” was
all Josephine said, until they remembered to thank
the postmaster for his kindness.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve the little girls could keep their
secret no longer, and solemnly presented their
mother with the magic gift.</p>

<p>Mother cried. Tears of joy rolled down her face
when she saw it.</p>

<p>“I never before had a picture of any of you children,”
said she, “and I never expected to, because
we live so far from a photographer. And this is so
beautiful! Such happy faces! Oh, it seems too good
to be true! It would not have happened if you were
not such good little girls, always thinking of your
mother!”</p>

<p>The next day two joyous little girls danced about
the cabin, singing:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“White magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christmas magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought our mother a Christmas gift!</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gold magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christmas magic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought our mother a Christmas gift!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>And the two little faces in the picture smiled down
upon the happy family cheerfully, then and ever
after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everybody’s</span> hands were quite full of little pin-pricks
from the holly leaves. Alan and David and little
Alice had all been helping with the Christmas
greens, and at last the wreaths were securely fastened
on tiny tacks in the windows, and sprays of
holly peeped festively out from behind each picture.
There was a large red paper bell hanging from the
chandelier in the hall for Santa Claus to ring when
he came in, and beside it a sprig of mistletoe, so
there would be no embarrassment about kissing him
in case he should be caught.</p>

<p>It was Christmas eve, and we all gathered around
the fire to rest after our labors and to speculate
about the prospects for the morrow. “Suppose he
doesn’t come,” surmised David, “or suppose he
would bring us only switches!” The thought was
terrifying.</p>

<p>“It all depends on what you deserve,” I answered.
“Santa Claus has a way, you know, of finding out
just what each child really ought to get.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Alan, the skeptic, “there are some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
who say there isn’t any Santa Claus—that he’s just
a story made up by older people to amuse the children.
I never knew of any one who’d seen him.”</p>

<p>Alice gasped. “You will get only switches, Alan,
if you say such things,” she warned him.</p>

<p>“There are people who deny everything that’s
good and true,” I took the conversation over, “but
their lack of faith hurts no one as much as themselves.
Would you like to hear about the old man
who denied there was a Santa Claus and to learn
what happened to him?”</p>

<p>“Please, please!” they all cried, and I began the
story:</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was an old man whose
name was Mr. Grouch, and he had lived so many
years that he could hardly count them. He was little,
and thin, and bent over, and wrinkled, and he had
a scraggly little beard and cross, snapping eyes.
He used to carry a big stick that he would shake
at the boys when they laughed at him, and he never
had a smile for anybody. He lived all alone with
one crabbed old man-servant in a vast house, and
no one even dared to ring the doorbell.</p>

<p>One Christmas eve I was coming down the street
taking gifts around to some friends, and my mind
was full of Christmas. There was a new fall of snow
on the ground and the sleighbells were jingling.
Even the busy shopkeepers seemed to be in the
Christmas spirit. Banks of fir-trees stood on the
corners, and every now and then I passed some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
proudly carrying home a tree over his shoulder.
All of a sudden, whom should I see coming toward
me but old Mr. Grouch, looking crosser than ever.
He was shaking his stick at the Christmas trees and
scowling at the fat turkeys, and for a moment I
was half afraid to speak to him. Still it seemed too
bad not to give the old man the season’s greetings,
so I called out as cheerily as I could—“A Merry
Christmas to you, Mr. Grouch!”</p>

<p>He turned on me, coming quite close and shaking
his big stick in my face, so that he frightened me.
“A Merry Nonsense!” he snarled, biting the words
off short. “You should go home and attend to your
business, not go running around wasting your own
time and other people’s. This Merry Christmasing
is all nonsense, I tell you, fit only for children and
simpletons. There’s no such person as Santa Claus!
It’s all a myth concocted by idle folk to fool the
children.”</p>

<p>I stood quite still, rooted to the spot, in terror lest
Santa Claus should see me in such bad company.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’re saying, Mr.
Grouch!” I finally brought out. “It’s wicked to deny
the spirit of Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Wicked or not wicked,” he retorted, “I say it
again—A Merry Nonsense to you and all your
kind!”</p>

<p>He looked so fierce that I hastened on my way
without another word, and as I turned the corner, I
still heard him muttering—“A Merry Nonsense! A
Merry Nonsense!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>On he went homeward to his great dreary house,
and there he found a frugal supper laid out by the
old man-servant. He ate without appetite and then
went upstairs. Then, after stuffing cotton in his ears
and closing both the windows and the shutters to
keep out the music of the bells and Christmas crackers,
he climbed into his large four-poster bed, and
pulling his nightcap down over his head, he went
fast asleep.</p>

<p>How long he slept, he never knew, but suddenly
he awoke hearing a strange sound. “<i>Plump!</i>” It was
over near the fireplace, and there was a great rush
of falling soot and plaster.</p>

<p>Mr. Grouch sat up quickly, scratched a match, and
lighted his bedside candle. He lifted it high and
scanned the room, peering out over the bed-clothes
like a strange gnome in his pointed nightcap. He
stared at the fireplace, and there—what do you
think he saw? He could scarcely believe his eyes—and
yet, sure enough, it was Santa Claus, dressed
all in ermine and scarlet velvet, red cheeks glowing
from the cold, his white beard glistening with snowflakes.
There he stood chuckling softly and rubbing
his hands together, the jolliest possible twinkle in
his kind blue eyes.</p>

<p>“A Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Grouch,” he said
in a deep hearty voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Grouch trembled so that the candle wax
dripped on his hand. “A Merry Christmas, Sir,”
he said, his voice sounding queer and squeaky.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Grouch,” said Santa Claus, smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
broadly, “that doesn’t sound natural from you. Why
don’t you say ‘A Merry Nonsense’? You don’t believe
in Santa Claus, and I know it, and I’ve come
here this evening to give you back your faith—as
a Christmas present. Put that candle down; get out
of bed and into your clothes while I count three.
My reindeer will be tired waiting.”</p>

<p>Then you should have seen Mr. Grouch scramble.
He popped his thin legs into his trousers and laced
up his boots with shaking fingers; then he pulled on
his greatcoat and wound his long knitted muffler
round his neck just as Santa Claus said three!</p>

<p>“You’ve forgotten your hat,” Santa Claus reminded
him, chuckling. And sure enough, there he
stood, the funniest figure you can imagine, still with
his pointed nightcap on his head. He tore off his
cap and placed his old beaver in its stead just as
Santa Claus gave him a great boost that sent him
flying up the chimney. Santa followed close after,
and Mr. Grouch could hear him puffing and panting,
and digging his boots into the side of the chimney
as he came up behind him.</p>

<p>On top of the house it was all singularly quiet
and peaceful. There was snow everywhere, on all
the roofs as far as the eye could reach, and above
was the limitless heaven with the calm stars shining
out.</p>

<p>Santa Claus stretched his arm toward the East.
“It was there,” he said, “before I was born, that
the wise men saw the Star of Bethlehem.” His
voice was so full and deep that the old man trembled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
He looked out over the great city and saw
in a thousand homes the candles burning for Christmas.
A group of singers, strolling by in the street,
stopped and began to sing a Christmas carol. Suddenly
the bells rang out from churches far and near.
It was midnight, they were pealing the glad tidings.</p>

<p>“We must be off,” said Santa Claus; “we are
already late; we must be going.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grouch noticed now for the first time a wonderful
little sleigh drawn by eight reindeer harnessed
in pairs together. In it lay Santa Claus’s
great pack, bursting with toys, and candy, and all
sorts of joy for the children. One or two switches
which Mr. Grouch saw sticking out on the top gave
him a sense of uneasiness. “Get in, my man, get
in!” commanded Santa Claus, and they leaped into
the sleigh. The reindeer pawed the snow and
snorted; then Santa Claus gave them the word and
away they went. Over the housetops and over the
trees, on—on—like a wind through the heavens. The
old man clutched his hat down close on his head and
shook with fear as he saw the great city glide by
beneath them. Past the great houses they went and
never drew rein. “They’re rich there,” said Santa
Claus; “they have more than they need. We won’t
stop; they’re untrue to the Spirit of Christmas.”</p>

<p>After a time they came to a part of the town
where the houses were all small and wretched-looking.
“These are my boys and girls,” said Santa,
as he drew up on the roof of a particularly sorry-looking
little dwelling. The reindeer shook their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
great horns and their bells jingled. The old man
looked doubtfully at Santa Claus and then at the
little chimney.</p>

<p>“Can we get down?” he asked fearfully.</p>

<p>“It’s the size of their hearts, not the size of their
chimneys, that makes the difference,” answered
Santa Claus. “I’ll go first and you follow.”</p>

<p>He stepped in the chimney and down he went, and
then Mr. Grouch stepped in and down he went, also.
The fire was out, and they found themselves in a
tiny little room all cold and wintry. Two little stockings
were hanging by the hearth, long and lank and
empty, and in a bed near by, two little children were
sleeping. They were smiling happily as they slept,
dreaming of Christmas morning. Before the empty
fireplace a woman was sitting, dressed all in black.
She was slight and small, and around her thin
shoulders she had drawn a shawl to protect herself
from the cold. Here there was no holly, no wreaths
in the windows, nothing at all to suggest Christmas
except the unfilled stockings. The little mother had
her eyes fixed on the dead ashes, and her thoughts
could not have been happy for tears were rolling
down her cheeks. “Oh, the poor children!” she whispered
to herself, with something very like a sob,
“what will they do in the morning?” She hid her
face in her hands and began to weep bitterly; and
it was just at this juncture that Santa Claus and Mr.
Grouch came down the chimney.</p>

<p>“Her husband died two months ago,” whispered
Santa Claus to Mr. Grouch, “and she has nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
in the house for Christmas,—no toys, no Christmas
turkey, no nuts and raisins, nothing at all to fill
those hungry stockings.” A large tear rolled down
his cheek. Mr. Grouch sniffed and looked uneasily
at the sleeping children.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Santa Claus, “watch and see what
happens.”</p>

<p>While the little widow sobbed on, he took one
thing after another out of his wonderful pack—nuts,
raisins, candy canes, a beautiful great doll
with yellow curls and blue eyes that went to sleep,
a little railway-train, a top, a small tea-set, a doll’s
chair, and finally, several pieces of nice warm clothing.
Then he proceeded to fill the stockings with
remarkable speed. When they were finished, the
doll was peeping out of one, and the little engine out
of the other. Mr. Grouch thought it was all over; but
no, Santa Claus reached far down into his pack
once more and brought out a beautiful Christmas
basket. The fat legs of a turkey were standing out
amid cranberries, and sweet potatoes, and oranges,
and apples, and every other sort of good thing you
can imagine.</p>

<p>Santa Claus placed the basket under the stockings,
and then poked Mr. Grouch in the ribs so hard
that it made him jump. “Now,” said he, “watch;
for she’ll be looking up.”</p>

<p>And sure enough, in a moment the little widow
sighed and raised her eyes. Then you should have
been there to see her. Her poor little face grew quite
pink with joy, she gasped, and her breath came fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
with bewilderment. She rubbed her eyes with her
thin hands; she couldn’t believe it was not a dream.
Then she gave a little cry, just between a sob and a
laugh, and fell on her knees before the basket.</p>

<p>She poked the fat turkey and felt deftly between
all the other things until she knew exactly what was
in the basket. “We’ll have a beautiful Christmas
dinner, after all,” she said, “even a turkey!” She
didn’t take a thing out of the stockings—just peeped
in and felt softly down the long knobby legs. “I’ll
leave them for the children just as he packed them,
the dear saint!” she murmured to herself. She went
over to the children and kissed each one softly; they
smiled and wriggled cosily in their sleep. Then she
looked over again at the wonderful hearthside—it
seemed to Mr. Grouch that she looked straight at
him, though of course she couldn’t see him as both
he and Santa Claus had on caps of darkness. Her
face was shining with a wonderful light of love and
joy. Her eyes beamed like two stars, and the room
seemed to be filled with a kind of glory. “It’s the
blessed spirit of Christmas,” she whispered brokenly,
“come to cheer my fatherless little ones and
me.” Then she knelt down by her little bed, and it
was plain that she was praying.</p>

<p>Santa Claus nodded triumphantly at Mr. Grouch,
shaking off another big tear, and Mr. Grouch returned
the look tremulously. He drew a large red
handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped both eyes
before speaking.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we take off our caps of darkness,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
finally whispered, “and wish her a Merry Christmas?”</p>

<p>“A Merry Nonsense!” said Santa Claus, laughing
until his fat sides shook; “no—we’re not allowed to
be seen. ’<i>Sh-h!</i> it’s time to go up the chimney.”</p>

<p>Up they went into the dark night where the reindeer
were waiting for them. Into the sleigh they
jumped and off they started, and, as the wind whistled
by them, Mr. Grouch said: “Santa Claus, I
feel I owe you an apology. When I saw her face—”</p>

<p>Santa Claus interrupted him: “If you’re ready
to admit you were wrong, go out to-morrow and
wish every one a Merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>Far, far away they went, out over the rolling sea
till they came to a ship which had had to sail out
from port just three days before Christmas. Down
into the forecastle they went, where the sailors were
sadly thinking of their homes, and spread cheer
around until each man wished the other a Merry
Christmas.</p>

<p>All the long night they sped over the great world
leaving joy behind them. They visited the children’s
hospitals, where little boys and girls were lying
awake, weeping for their mothers, and they quieted
them and touched them with joy, and they slept,
forgetful of their pain and sorrow. They visited
sinful men in prison and softened their hearts, and
they stopped at the homes of the rich and bade them
remember their poorer brothers.</p>

<p>It was a night to dream of, such as no one else
but Santa Claus can ever know again, but at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the pink glow of morning showed in the eastern
sky.</p>

<p>“It’s time to be getting home,” said Santa Claus.
“We can be seen if we’re out when the day is dawning.”</p>

<p>In a moment they had landed safely on Mr.
Grouch’s roof.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Santa Claus, as he politely
helped his passenger to alight and to shake off the
snow and start down the chimney, “and remember,
you are never to say you don’t believe in Santa
Claus again!”</p>

<p>“Never in all this world!” said Mr. Grouch, in
heartfelt tones. “Long live the spirit of Christmas!”
He took off his hat and bowed in an old-fashioned,
ceremonious manner just before the reindeer leaped
into the air and started in the direction of the
North Pole.</p>

<p>Mr. Grouch must have slid down the chimney and
gone to bed after that, but in the morning he had
forgotten all about that part of the adventure.</p>

<p>When the sun was high, the old man-servant
knocked at the door and reminded him that breakfast
was waiting. Mr. Grouch woke with a start. “A
Merry Christmas to you, Andrew,” he shouted.</p>

<p>The old servant ran almost all the way downstairs
with never a word. He thought his master must be
mad, for he had never heard him give that greeting
before in all his thirty years of service.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>On Christmas morning I went out to take some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
toys, to the crippled children’s hospital, and there,
coming down the street, whom should I see but old
Mr. Grouch, a gayly decorated little Christmas tree
over his shoulder, the pockets of his greatcoat bulging
with toys and candy, and behind him, trooping
merrily along, an endless chain of boys and girls,
each with a toy and a bag of candy.</p>

<p>I stood stock-still with surprise and waited for
the procession to come up.</p>

<p>“A Merry Christmas to you!” shouted Mr.
Grouch, his face glowing from the crisp air, and all
the children called out too, “A Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to take this tree to some fatherless
children,” he said: “would you like to come along
with us?”</p>

<p>When I found my voice, I explained my errand
and, quick as a wink, Mr. Grouch said they would
stop at the hospital too, on the way to the other
children. So on we went, all together, and everybody
smiled and beamed and echoed our joy as soon as
they saw us.</p>

<p>It must have been merely my imagination, but
Mr. Grouch’s voice sounded to me just like Santa
Claus’s as he wished everybody “Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>He spent the whole day going round from one
poor family to another, taking them toys and good
cheer and leaving joy everywhere behind him.</p>

<p>Now the most curious part of the story is yet
to come, for, would you believe it, Mr. Grouch has
grown quite fat and jolly as time has gone by, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
now, if you saw him, except for his black coat you
would think he was Santa Claus. He has round red
cheeks and a shining white beard, and his eyes are
no longer cross and snapping; they beam upon every
one the whole year round as if they were always
saying, “I wish you a Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>All of which goes to prove that Santa Claus is
just as real as we think him, for each one of us can
show by our own deeds and words the reality of the
Spirit of Christmas.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>I stopped.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Alice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, “the story is finished.”</p>

<p>“And now do you believe in Santa Claus?” said
David, looking hard at Alan.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the boy, drawing a long breath.
“Let’s go up to the play-room and get some of our
toys together to take to the hospital children tomorrow.
We’ll do it for the sake of the Spirit of
Christmas.”</p>

</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>John Clair Minot</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">David</span> and Florence Payson live with their parents
on a ranch in Montana. The nearest neighbor is a
mile away and the nearest town nearly twenty miles;
but that does not mean that they are so much out
of the world as city children may imagine.</p>

<p>Most city children—and most country children,
too, for that matter—count themselves fortunate to
have one Christmas a year; but last year David and
Florence Payson had two Christmases, and, moreover,
they are planning a double Christmas again
this year. The double Christmas came about in a
very simple way, and it gave them by far the happiest
holiday season that they had ever known.</p>

<p>The first of their two Christmases—and perhaps
some of us would call it their real Christmas—came
on Christmas Eve. There was a tree before the fireplace
in the cheery living room, and it was loaded
with good things that Mr. Payson had brought from
town a few days before. Flashing tinsel and rippling
streamers; bright flags and sprigs of crimson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
holly; golden fruit and candy of all kinds and colors;
toys, toys, toys; books and pictures; things to
wear and things to eat; and then more toys—all
these made the tree very beautiful and wonderful
to David and Florence when at last the living-room
doors were opened and they were free to rush in.
What a happy Christmas Eve they had then! In all
the wide land there were perhaps no children who
had a merrier time round their tree that night than
David and Florence Payson had in the big living
room of their lonely ranch house.</p>

<p>They took very few of the presents from the tree
that evening. It was enough to admire them, and
to dance round and round the tree in search of the
treasures hidden among the branches. When the
next morning came they were shouting “Merry
Christmas!” before their parents were awake, and
were at the tree as soon as it was light enough to
see.</p>

<p>At breakfast David suddenly asked, “Does everyone
have Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Everyone?” repeated Mr. Payson. “Well, I’m
afraid some have a good deal more Christmas than
others.”</p>

<p>David looked thoughtful. “Do you suppose that
family in the log cabin over behind the bluff has
any Christmas at all?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” admitted Mr. Payson, and Mrs.
Payson suddenly had the air of a person who all at
once remembers something very important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>David looked hard at his plate, and then he said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps we ought to take Christmas over to
them. We have so much that we can spare a little,
can’t we?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can, David,” said his mother
promptly. “I’ll fill a big basket with good things,
and you and your father can carry it right over.”</p>

<p>But before the basket was filled, a very natural
thought came to Florence.</p>

<p>“How can it be Christmas to them without a
tree?” she asked.</p>

<p>“They shall have a tree,” said Mr. Payson.
“Come, David, we’ll get one right now.”</p>

<p>David and his father found an axe and hurried
off to a clump of small pines that grew near the
river; there Mr. Payson cut down the most shapely
one he could find. When they returned with it, Mrs.
Payson and Florence had two baskets ready instead
of one. Into the first basket they had put food and
clothing. Into the second they had put some of the
ornaments and holly that had decorated their own
tree, and also a generous part of the fruit, candy
and toys.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll be Santa Claus &amp; Co.,” said Mr. Payson.
“David, you and Florence can ride old Diamond
and drag the tree. I’ve tied a rope to it. I’ll go ahead
on General with the baskets.”</p>

<p>That was the way the strange procession set out.
There was a light snow on the ground, but not
enough to make travel hard, and the two miles were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
soon crossed. General was faster than Diamond, and
a little while before the children reached the cabin
they met their father returning.</p>

<p>“I’ve left the baskets on the brow of the hill,” he
said. “You can easily drag them down to the door.
You two are really Santa Claus &amp; Co., you know.”</p>

<p>So, suddenly and without any warning whatever,
Christmas came to the log cabin. The family there
had staked out a claim the summer before, and they
had little more than the land itself. There were no
signs of any holiday celebration anywhere about the
shabby little place. It was indeed an amazed man
that opened the door to the children’s knock.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said David. “We’ve brought
Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Brought what?” the man said uncertainly.</p>

<p>“We’ve brought Christmas,” repeated David, and
he pointed to the tree and to the two big baskets that
he and Florence had dragged down the slope to the
door.</p>

<p>As he spoke, a woman joined the man at the door;
three little children were clinging to her skirts.</p>

<p>“Christmas!” she exclaimed, holding up her
hands. “Is this Christmas Day? I declare, we’d lost
track of the days altogether! Why, you blessed
angels, where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“We’re not blessed angels,” said Florence.
“We’re Santa Claus &amp; Co., and we live on the Payson
ranch over on the river.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said the man. He began to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
what it all meant. “Come right in. I’ll tie the
horse.”</p>

<p>David and Florence stamped the snow off and
went inside, dragging their gifts. The cabin was so
small that they had to cut off the top of the tree before
they could stand it up in the room. Then they
all joined in hanging up the decorations and the
gifts. The three children had said scarcely a word
at first, but they grew noisy with happiness as the
tree slowly began to display its wonderful fruit
before their eyes. Perhaps it was the most beautiful
Christmas Day that ever came to three little
folk who had not even known that it <i>was</i> Christmas
until nearly noon. And when the big parcels of
clothing were taken from the tree and opened one
by one there were tears of happiness in the grown
people’s eyes.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon David and Florence mounted
Diamond, waved good-by and rode back to the ranch.</p>

<p>“Which Christmas celebration was the better?”
asked their mother, when they had told the story of
their visit to the log cabin.</p>

<p>“Both were wonderful,” said David, “but somehow
we were even happier there than here.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was because the first was a getting
Christmas and the second was a giving Christmas,”
said Florence.</p>

<p>And in that sage remark Florence showed where
the richest happiness of the Christmas season lies.</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Elsie Singmaster</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the kitchen of the little house on the mountain-side
there was only one sound, the whirring of a
sewing-machine. The kitchen was a pleasant place.
There was a glowing fire in the stove, a brightly
striped rag carpet on the floor, and a red cloth on
the table. In three of the four deeply embrasured
windows were potted geraniums. By the fourth
stood the machine which whirred so busily.</p>

<p>It was Christmas eve, and if a little shawl and
sunbonnet and a little boy’s overcoat hanging on
pegs behind the door were any sign, there were children
in the house. But there was no sign of Christmas;
there were no stockings hung before the fire,
there was no tree, there were no presents. The
mother who turned the machine was making men’s
shirts of coarse fabric. To her right on a table lay
piles of separate portions of shirts—sleeves, fronts,
bands, cuffs; on the floor to her left, a great heap of
finished garments. Her bent head was motionless;
she was able to shift the material upon which she
was working from one side to the other without
moving her shoulders or lifting her eyes, so that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
seemed to work upon an unending seam. She had set
herself the finishing of a certain number of dozen
before the New Year, and she had her task almost
finished, though it was only Christmas eve.</p>

<p>By the table sat an old man. He had a bright face
and blue eyes; one would have said he had still a
good deal of the energy and strength of his youth.
He was reading the Christmas story in the Bible, but
his eyes strayed often from the page, whose contents
he knew by heart, to the figure by the machine.
Once when the left hand swept to the floor a finished
garment he started from his chair. But the right
hand was already gathering together the pieces of
another, and he sank back.</p>

<p>When the shrill little clock on the mantel struck
eleven and the deft hand gathered up still another
garment, the old man tiptoed to the door and opened
it. He went across the yard and there entered a little
shop and struck a match. Then he exclaimed in joy
over the product of his own hands.</p>

<p>“It’s the handsomest I ever seen!” said he.</p>

<p>Almost filling the little shop, its proud head bent,
its wide arms spread benignantly, stood a Christmas
tree, gorgeous, glittering. Each tiny twig was tipped
with a white ball; among the branches hung thick
clusters of golden fruit. There was no other color;
the old gentleman had, it was clear, fine taste in
Christmas trees.</p>

<p>Beneath the tree was a village. Into green moss
were stuck little tree-like sprigs of pine; scattered
about were miniature houses. Here a little horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
carved out of wood drew a cart; here a flock of
sheep wandered. There was a mill beside a glassy
pond—a mill whose wheel, set in the brook in summer-time,
would really turn. On one side of the garden
stood a full-sized sled, upon it a chess-board,
both hand-made, but neatly finished; upon the other
side a doll’s cradle with a little squirrel skin cut
neatly for a cover, and two necklaces, one of rose
hips and one of gourd seeds. Before the garden lay
another group of presents—a neatly carved spool-holder
and a little pile of skins for muff or tippet.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sight even to one who had had
no hand in the making. But now suddenly the old
man’s enthusiasm seemed to fail. He shook his head
solemnly and went back to the house.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to tell her soon,” said he. “I’ll have to
tell her now.”</p>

<p>Then the clock on the mantel struck twelve, the
machine stopped, and the worker got stiffly to her
feet. She was a tall, strong person, with a sad, preoccupied
face. It was difficult to believe that she was
the daughter of the little blue-eyed old man. At once
he, too, rose and laid his book on the table. He looked
up at the tall figure as though he were a little
afraid of it.</p>

<p>“Susan,” said he, “are you tired?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Susan.</p>

<p>“Susan,” the old man began with a little gasp,
“I wish you’d—” He looked longingly toward the
door which led out toward the little shop.</p>

<p>“You wish I’d what, gran’pap?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The old man’s courage failed completely.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d go to bed, Susan.”</p>

<p>“I am going,” answered Susan. “Good night,
gran’pap.”</p>

<p>When the last sound of Susan’s step had died
away, gran’pap put coal on the fire and blew out the
light.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! oh my!” said he. “What will she say
when she finds it out?”</p>

<p>Then, slowly, forgetting that the lamp burned in
the little shop across the yard, he climbed the stairs.</p>

<p>It was almost three months since the subject of
Christmas had been broached in the little house.
Then, one pleasant October afternoon, when the
children left the main road and turned in at the by-road
which led toward home, they found gran’pap
sitting on the fence. He missed the children, who,
dinner-pail and books in hand, walked two miles to
the schoolhouse before half-past eight in the morning
and did not return until half-past four in the
afternoon. Thomas could have covered the distance
much more speedily, but little Eliza could not walk
fast. Now in October, the sun was already near its
setting.</p>

<p>Gran’pap had a knife in his hand and was whittling
something very tiny. When the children came
in sight, he put both knife and handiwork into his
pocket. He greeted them with a cheerful shout, and
they smiled at him and came up slowly. Thomas and
Eliza took their pleasures very soberly. Though
gran’pap had lived with them since spring, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
not yet accustomed to his levity, fascinating as it
was.</p>

<p>Eliza took his hand and trotted in a satisfied way
beside him. She was a fat little girl, and her old-fashioned
clothes made her look like a demure person
of middle age. Thomas stepped along on the
other side, trying to set each foot as far ahead of
the other as gran’pap did.</p>

<p>“Well,” said gran’pap, “here we are!”</p>

<p>“And what,” said Thomas, with a happy skip and
a wave of the dinner-pail, “what are we going to do
to-night?”</p>

<p>Gran’pap sniffed the sharp air, which promised
frost.</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear the chestnuts rattlin’ Saturday!”
said he. “I have poles ready for beatin’ ’em,
and I made each of you a pair of mittens for hullin’
’em.”</p>

<p>Saturday’s pleasure, while delectable, was still
too far away and too uncertain for Thomas.</p>

<p>“But to-night, gran’pap, what about to-night?”</p>

<p>“To-night,” said gran’pap, solemnly, having approached
the greater joy through the less, “to-night
we make our plans for Christmas!”</p>

<p>“For Christmas?” said Thomas and Eliza together.</p>

<p>“Why, you act as though you never seen or heard
of Christmas!” mocked the old man. “As though
you were heathen!”</p>

<p>“We haven’t seen Christmas,” said the little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“I did once,” corrected Thomas. “There was a
tree with bright gold things on it and lights. We
had it in the house. I guess ’Lizie couldn’t remember;
she was very little.” He drew closer to the old
man and spoke in a low tone, “He was here still.”</p>

<p>“But last Christmas and the Christmas before.
You had a tree then?”</p>

<p>“No,” insisted the little boy.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s trees in plenty!” cried gran’pap.
“But perhaps,” added he, hurriedly, “perhaps she
couldn’t get any one to cut it for her. But you had
presents!”</p>

<p>“The Snyder children had a present,” said little
Eliza. “It was a sled, Sandy Claus brought it.”</p>

<p>“But <i>you</i> had presents,” insisted gran’pap.</p>

<p>“No,” said Thomas and Eliza together.</p>

<p>“I guess she was very busy,” said gran’pap, with
a frown. Then face and voice brightened. “But this
year I’m on hand to cut the tree and I’m on hand
to trim the tree.”</p>

<p>The children looked up at him. It was clear that
they had not entire faith in gran’pap’s powers.</p>

<p>“And presents,” continued gran’pap. “If you
could have your choice of presents, what would you
like to have?”</p>

<p>“I would like a gun,” said Thomas.</p>

<p>“I would like—” Little Eliza gave a long, long
sigh—“I would like a locket. I saw one in a picture.”</p>

<p>“I do not know what you will get,” said the old
man, “but you will get something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Then gran’pap hurried his own steps and theirs.</p>

<p>“She’ll be lookin’ for us, children. Mooley’s to be
milked and wood’s to be fetched.”</p>

<p>Further progress was swift, for the road
descended sharply. Under the shelter of a small cliff-like
elevation stood the little house, startlingly white
in the thickening darkness. It was a lonely place,
entirely out of sight of other houses. Though it
was protected from the coldest of the winter
winds, it was not out of reach of their mournful
sound.</p>

<p>From the kitchen window a bright light shone.
Susan lit the lamp by her machine early. They could
see her head and shoulders plainly as she bent over
her work. At sight of her gran’pap and the children
became silent.</p>

<p>“She’s always busy,” said gran’pap, after a moment.
“She’s wonderful, she is.”</p>

<p>Thomas and Eliza made no answer. They had had
no experience with a mother who was not perpetually
busy. Gran’pap began to whistle, as though to warn
her of their presence, and she lifted her head and
looked out into the dusk. Her face, now as always
intensely grave and preoccupied, brightened a little.
The company of a grown person must have been a
blessing in this quiet spot. For three years Susan
had lived here alone with her children.</p>

<p>Gran’pap did not go at once into the house, but
took from the bench beside the door a large milk-pail
and went to the barn. The children followed
him, and stood just inside the door, listening to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
milk rattling into the pail. Gran’pap talked to
Mooley, complimenting her upon her sleek coat and
her beautiful eyes, upon her gentleness, and upon
the abundance of her milk. When he had finished,
he and the children went into the house together.
Thomas took off his cap and Eliza her shawl and
sunbonnet, and gran’pap hung them up on the high
pegs. Then he looked sorrowfully at the figure before
the sewing-machine.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you stopping yet, Susan?”</p>

<p>“I must make one more,” came the answer from
the bent head. “The man comes to fetch them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But not till afternoon, Susan, and see all you
have done!”</p>

<p>Susan made no answer. Stepping quietly, gran’pap
poured the milk into crocks, and carried the
crocks into the cellar. When he returned, he gave
the fire a little shake and began to get supper. He
set the table and cut the potatoes and meat for stew,
and put the stew on the stove. As he sliced the onion
he made queer grimaces to amuse Thomas and
Eliza. When a savory odor began to rise, the figure
at the machine turned.</p>

<p>“You needn’t ’a’ done that, gran’pap!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Susan. Now when you’re done, supper’ll
be ready.”</p>

<p>The machine whirred a little faster, the hands
moved a little more swiftly. The sleeves of a shirt
were added to the body, the band was put in place.
Once Susan sighed, but so quickly did the whirring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
sound begin once more that the sigh reached the
ears of no one but herself.</p>

<p>The two children sat, meanwhile, upon the settle,
their school-books in their hands. But they did not
study. They pondered upon what gran’pap had said.
Gran’pap had brought many miracles to pass. It
was possible that he would bring this heavenly one
to pass also. Sometimes they whispered to each
other.</p>

<p>When the whirring machine stopped and the
mother pushed back her chair, gran’pap announced
the feast ready. Susan carried the lamp from the
machine to the table. She looked wretchedly tired.
She rubbed her hand across her forehead, and when
she sat down at the table she shielded her eyes from
the light.</p>

<p>For once the children did not see that she was
tired, for once they burst without thought into
speech. Gran’pap’s promise had intoxicated them.</p>

<p>“Gran’pap says we will have a Christmas,” said
Thomas, before he had lifted his spoon.</p>

<p>“With a big tree. He will cut it.”</p>

<p>“And with presents,” said Eliza.</p>

<p>“I would like a gun,” said Thomas.</p>

<p>“And I a locket,” said Eliza.</p>

<p>The mother shivered. She put her hands again to
her forehead and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” said she. “There will be no Christmas.”</p>

<p>“But, Susan—”</p>

<p>Susan looked straight at her father. Her answer
was final, but it was not rude; it sounded cruel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
but the old man was neither hurt nor offended.</p>

<p>“This is my house, father. There can be no tree
and no presents. I cannot stand a tree, and I have
no money for presents.”</p>

<p>The old man uttered a single “But”—then he
said no more. The faces of Thomas and Eliza
dropped, but they said nothing. After a while they
looked furtively at their grandfather, as though to
see how this correcting of his plans affected him.
When they saw that tears dropped from his eyes,
they looked down upon their plates.</p>

<p>But grandfather was not long sad. He helped
Susan to clear the table, then he sat down with the
children. When they had finished their sums and
had learned their spelling lesson and had read—toes
on the stripe in the carpet, backs straight, books
held in a prescribed manner—their reading lessons,
he drew animals for them and cut rows of soldiers
for Thomas and babies for Eliza. Their mother
folded the shirts she had finished, laid fresh work
on the machine for the morning, and sewed for an
hour by hand on a dress for Eliza. Then she bade
the children go to bed.</p>

<p>“Are you going to sit up, gran’pap?” she asked,
gently.</p>

<p>“A little,” said gran’pap.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Susan.</p>

<p>Gran’pap sat by the table for a long time, his
head on his hand. Gradually the expression of his
face changed from sadness to a grim yet tender
determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“We will see,” said he aloud.</p>

<p>Then he read a chapter in his Bible and went to
bed.</p>

<p>On Saturday gran’pap and the children went
chestnutting. Their luck was amazing. After enough
chestnuts had been reserved to supply the family’s
most extensive needs, there were ten quarts to be
sold. With the money they bought ten spools of
thread for Susan.</p>

<p>“You’ll get more for your work if you don’t have
to pay your money for thread,” said gran’pap.</p>

<p>Susan gave a little gasp. One who did not know
her might have thought that she was about to cry.
But Susan never cried.</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to have spent your money for me,”
she said.</p>

<p>If gran’pap was disappointed or grieved because
Susan had said that the children could have no
Christmas, he did not show it. He kept the wood-box
full, he drove Mooley along the roadside to find
a little late grass, and he heard the children say
their lessons. When he was not thus occupied, he
was in his little shop across the yard. Thither he
had brought from his old home a jig-saw, a small
turning lathe, and sundry other carpenter tools. He
had here a little stove, and here on stormy days he
worked. On pleasant days he made repairs to the
house and barn, so that they should be winter-tight.</p>

<p>“The squirrels have thick coats,” said he. “Look
out for cold weather!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, gran’pap disregarded entirely
his daughter’s prohibition. When the children
were at school and late at night, gran’pap was at
work. He carved the animals for the garden and
made the little houses and the cradle and the chessboard,
and he gilded walnuts and hickory nuts to
hang upon the tree, and popped the corn to make the
little balls for the finishing of each branch. It was a
long task; gran’pap often sat up half the night.
Sometimes he worked in hope, sometimes in despair.</p>

<p>“When she sees it in its grandeur, she will feel
different,” said he when he was hopeful.</p>

<p>“Trouble’s got fixed on her mind,” said he when
he despaired. “Perhaps she can’t change any more.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll try”—this was the invariable conclusion
of grandfather’s meditations. “For the sake of her
and these children, I’ll try.”</p>

<p>Several times gran’pap was almost caught. The
odor of popcorn was sniffed by Thomas and Eliza,
returning a little earlier than usual from school, and
a large supply had to be handed over to them. A spot
of gilding on gran’pap’s coat was explained with
difficulty. For the last days after the great tree had
been dragged into the shop and set up gran’pap was
in constant fear.</p>

<p>“On Christmas eve, after those children are in
bed, I’ll take her over,” planned gran’pap. “I’ll
have a light burning. When she sees the tree, she’ll
feel different.”</p>

<p>But now Christmas eve was past and Susan had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
not been led to the little shop. Susan had gone to
her room and gran’pap had gone to his and Christmas
morning was almost at hand. Gran’pap had
never been so miserable.</p>

<p>“She’ll never forgive me,” said he, as he lay
down upon his bed and looked up at the stars. “Oh,
dear! oh dear!”</p>

<p>At two o’clock gran’pap woke, conscious of a disturbance
of mind. He lay for a moment thinking of
Susan, then he realized that it was another uneasiness
which had disturbed him.</p>

<p>“I left that light burning!” said he, as he sprang
out of bed.</p>

<p>He dressed quickly, and went down the stairs into
the kitchen. To his consternation the door stood
ajar.</p>

<p>“Burglars!” said gran’pap. Then gran’pap stood
still. The shop was on the side of Susan’s room; he
saw in the dim firelight that Susan’s shawl was gone
from its hook.</p>

<p>“Oh my! oh my!” said gran’pap, as he made his
way across the yard.</p>

<p>Then he came to another abrupt pause in his
progress. He heard a sound, a strange sound, the
sound of crying. He tiptoed closer to the door of
the shop. Within sat Susan upon a low bench, her
head bent low, her hands across her face. He could
see her shoulders heave, he could hear the pitiful
sound of her sobbing.</p>

<p>Gran’pap was in despair. He did not know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
he should do, whether he should go forward or back.
It was evident at least that his plan had not been
successful.</p>

<p>“She’s never cried before,” said he.</p>

<p>Then, seeing Susan rise, he took a middle course
and stepped into the shadow of the little building.
Susan did not give another glance at the beautiful
tree with its out-stretched arms; she went across
the yard, still crying, and into the house.</p>

<p>“She even forgot to lock the door,” said gran’pap,
as he went into the shop.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment and looked at the tree.</p>

<p>“We can keep the door locked,” said he, mournfully.
“I can give ’em the things another time. Perhaps
she would let me give ’em each one thing this
morning.”</p>

<p>Then gran’pap heard a stir, the sound of a footstep,
the rustle of approaching skirts. He turned
and faced the door.</p>

<p>“Susan!” said he.</p>

<p>It was Susan come back, Susan with a burden in
her arms. She looked at her father with a start. Her
face was different. It was suddenly clear that she
had been a beautiful girl. She laid her burden upon
the little bench.</p>

<p>“Here is a little rifle that was his father’s,” said
she. “And here is a little chain and locket that was
mine. You put them under the tree, gran’pap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Susan!” said the old man.</p>

<p>But Susan was already at the door. There she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
turned and looked back. Again she was crying, but
she was smiling, too. It was plain that for Susan
the worst of grief was past.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, gran’pap!” said she. “You’d
better go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Same to you!” faltered gran’pap.</p>

<p>Then he took the little rifle and the chain and
locket in his hands and hugged them to his breast.</p>

<p>“Oh my! oh my! oh my!” said gran’pap. “What
will those children do!”</p>

SANTA CLAUS<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Harrison Cady</i></p>


<p>“No, sir-ree, you don’t catch me giving anything to
Christmas charity. No, sir-ree! It’s all nonsense
anyway,” said old Mr. Long-Tail as he slammed his
door shut with a great bang right in the face of a
startled snowbird who had called to solicit a contribution
for the Christmas fund for the poor and
needy.</p>

<p>Then with a frown he turned, drawing his old
padded dressing gown more closely about him, and
hobbled over to his large easy-chair before the blazing
fire. Seating himself among its cushions he proceeded
to pour out a steaming bowl of broth from a
copper pot and to help himself to a bit of toast from
a trivet before the fire.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he squeaked. “This is pretty snug,”
and his lips curled into a satisfied smile as he glanced
over to where the boisterous snowflakes were dashing
against the window pane.</p>

<p>“Who-o-o! Who-o-o!” whistled the cold North
Wind as it rattled the shutters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Crackety-crackety,” answered back the leaping
flames in the grate with a merry shower of sparks.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Long-Tail was snug—very, very snug.
His comfortable little house fairly glowed with
warmth, and its pantry shelves sagged under their
weight of good things. So, on this cold winter’s day,
the Day-Before-Christmas, he of all the many forest
folk could afford to scoff and shoo away unwelcome
callers. For why should he worry about the needy
and the cold? His shelves were full and his fire was
warm. Besides, did he not have many storehouses
filled to overflowing?</p>

<p>But many there were in the great world who were
not as free from worry as Mr. Long-Tail. Many
days of heavy storms and cruel winds had drifted
the snow and covered fields and forests alike with a
thick white mantle which, freezing, had made it
almost impossible for many little creatures to reach
their hidden stores or to find a stray berry.</p>

<p>For weeks past they had been watching and waiting
in the hope of better weather. Christmas was
drawing near, and they had planned a grand celebration
around a great fir tree which grew on a lofty
knoll at the very edge of the forest. They had
planned to trim it from top to bottom with long garlands
of holly, while myriads of blazing candles
would glisten and sparkle as they shed their light
upon boughs heavily laden with presents.</p>

<p>Then one day came Bad Weather, and with him a
great blizzard which howled and shrieked and added
huge drifts of snow. The little forest people looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
out from their windows to see the blizzard imps
dancing in glee, and as days went by they slowly
gave up hope of the great Christmas celebration.
Many tiny creatures watched their storehouses of
provisions gradually disappear under the snow, and
each day saw the list of the needy increase.</p>

<p>So the Day-Before-Christmas found every little
eye carrying a look of worry and every little voice
sobbed: “We can do but little for this Christmas,
and that only for the very poor,” all but old Mr.
Long-Tail. His eyes held no look of worry. He was
in a class by himself, for, as sometimes happens, not
any of his storehouses were buried and every snowflake
that fell before his door seemed to be instantly
whisked away by the North Wind.</p>

<p>And so he sat before his fire and drank his
broth and wheezed in his most disagreeable voice:
“Christmas! Bah! I’ll have none of it!”</p>

<p>For to explain: Old Mr. Long-Tail was a rat, and
a very miserly one at that. In fact, he traced his
pedigree directly back to the great family of Miser
Rats, who had a habit of gathering hoards of curious
things and tucking them away in funny little storehouses
where one could find everything from an old
button to a bit of brightly colored glass, along with
queer dried roots and vegetables. Old Mr. Long-Tail
had lived a long time and, as he had likewise inherited
the family traits, his storehouses were many.</p>

<p>So he sat all alone the Day-Before-Christmas,
buried in his great armchair, and thought only of
how very comfortable he was—he, the very richest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
creature in the great forest. But old Mr. Long-Tail
was not happy, for with all his great riches there was
one thing more he longed for—that was a certain
kind of yellow corn, and that corn was hidden away
in a certain corn bin in a certain old barn a goodly
distance away.</p>

<p>“Ah! If I only had a little of that fine corn for
my Christmas dinner,” sighed old Mr. Long-Tail,
for secretly he did intend to celebrate Christmas
Day, but all by himself.</p>

<p>Finally he went to the window and peered out.
“Whew! It’s a pretty rough day, but I believe I
might make it,” he exclaimed as he drew on his big
coat and wound his woolen scarf about his neck.
Then he threw an empty sack over his shoulder and,
buckling on a pair of snowshoes, headed straight
for that distant barn.</p>

<p>Reaching it after a very long and difficult trip, he
removed his snowshoes and crawled under the old
building until he came to a convenient crack in the
floor, and raising himself carefully he crept noiselessly
within. Everything was silent and deserted
except for the groaning of the wind about the eaves.
Mr. Long-Tail lost no time in getting across the
floor to a large wooden bin beside the wall, and he
sped quickly along its side until he came to an opening,
and then, with a hurried look over his shoulder,
he stepped inside—not inside the bin, but right into
a large box trap, the cover of which dropped with a
thunderous clap, and old Mr. Long-Tail found himself
a prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>It was all so sudden and unexpected that it quite
took his breath away. He tried to find a way of
escape, but there was no escape for old Mr. Long-Tail.
Exhausted, he crouched down and moaned,
“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I’m caught! I’m caught!” and
his falling tears went splash as they fell on the
floor of his prison.</p>

<p>Yes, he was caught, and caught so well that unless
something unforeseen happened he was doomed to
spend his Christmas Day in that box trap. Poor old
Mr. Long-Tail, who had planned to celebrate all
alone with a delicious feast!</p>

<p>One hour passed; then another; then many more
followed, and Mr. Long-Tail commenced to feel cold
and hungry—yes, hungry right in that terrible trap
in that well-filled corn bin. He shivered and shivered
until the old box trap fairly made the corn rattle.</p>

<p>“Hush! Hush! What’s that?” whispered one little
snowbird to another as they huddled under the eaves
of the old barn. “I hear sumfin.”</p>

<p>Just then old Mr. Long-Tail gave a low moan.</p>

<p>“Whew!—Someone is in distress,” cried the little
snowbirds together as they cocked their heads to
one side and listened.</p>

<p>Again came a moan.</p>

<p>“Whew! Some poor soul is in distress and we
must help him.”</p>

<p>And those two little snowbirds spread their wings
and went whirling down to a window sill, and finding
a broken pane they poked their heads in and listened
until they heard the sob again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Then they both peeped loudly: “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>Faintly from the bin came a plaintive cry: “Help!
Help! It’s me, poor Mr. Long-Tail.”</p>

<p>The two little snowbirds without hesitation flew
right into the old barn and commenced to investigate.</p>

<p>“It’s old Mr. Long-Tail all right,” said one as he
spied the tip of the rat’s tail protruding from the
end of the box. “Oh! So you are the crabbed old
fellow who shooed us away from your door this
morning,” said the other upon recognizing Mr.
Long-Tail’s voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Long-Tail sobbed: “Set me free, and anything
I own is yours.”</p>

<p>“We are going to set you free all right,” cried the
little birds, “but we don’t want anything of yours.
No, sir. We only accept presents from willing givers,
and just to show you, we are going to return good
for evil.” And straightway they began to dig those
yellow ears of corn from under the old box trap.
Suddenly it fell on its side and the cover opened
enough for Mr. Long-Tail to slip out. He didn’t stop,
and he didn’t even thank those little snowbirds for
saving his life. No. He only ran just as fast as his
legs would carry him straight for his home.</p>

<p>“My! That was a narrow escape,” he puffed as he
bolted his heavy door. “You don’t catch me leaving
this snug little house again”; and he stirred the fire
and dropped down into his big easy-chair.</p>

<p>For a long, long time he sat and looked into the
crackling flames as they danced and leaped up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
chimney. Then gradually old Mr. Long-Tail commenced
to see strange shapes. Curious visions appeared—visions
new and strange; and along with
them came troubling thoughts, and, do all he could,
he couldn’t shut them out.</p>

<p>As the flames danced they shaped themselves into
weird pictures of huddled creatures bent with cold
and hunger, as they drew their cloaks about them.
He could hear the roar of the winter tempest; he saw
lines of empty stockings and heard plaintive calls
for food. Then he saw a score of rich storehouses
filled to overflowing, with doors heavily barred,
while before them walked a grotesque figure, and
that figure was turning away groups of starving
forest folk. And, last of all, he saw two tiny snowbirds
helping someone out of a trap, someone who
whined and whimpered and cried: “Help! Help! It’s
me, poor Mr. Long-Tail.”</p>

<p>This was too much for him. He jumped suddenly
to his feet and cried: “That’s me, a mean old miser,
who does nothing for anyone but himself. The poor
and needy I turn away, and I don’t even thank those
who save my life—me, poor old Miser Long-Tail.”</p>

<p>Ashamed and humbled he sat down again and remained
motionless for a long, long time. Then, with
a sudden cry of joy, he jumped to his feet and looked
at the clock.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! There’s yet time. There are still a few
hours left,” he cried as he drew on his coat and,
gathering a pile of empty bags together, he disappeared
into the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>The Night-Before-Christmas! That magic hour of
all the year when Santa Claus, behind his team of
reindeer steeds, rides hither and thither from one
chimney top to another. But on this particular night
the little creatures of the great forest had given up
all hope of any Christmas visitor and were huddled
in their beds for warmth. They were fast asleep,
dreaming their troubled dreams of empty shelves
and stockings. Outside the great world lay covered
with ice and snow, for the blizzard had gone on its
way and a cold winter moon shone on the hanging
icicles.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there came, at the exact hour of
twelve, the ringing of a bell. The little people awoke
with a start and in excited voices cried: “It’s a
Christmas bell! It’s a Christmas bell!”</p>

<p>In a flash they were out of their beds, and, hurriedly
dressing, they scampered toward the echoing
bell.</p>

<p>And what do you suppose they saw?</p>

<p>A smiling old rat, who, with the aid of his long
tail, was ringing the bell! While before him on the
ground was spread a wonderful collection of Christmas
gifts, and above all was the sign:</p>

<p class="large c">
<span class="smcap">Peace on Earth<br>
And Good Will Toward Men<br>
A Merry Christmas to All!<br>
From Mr. Long-tail.</span>

</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Florence Morse Kingsley</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the deep valley below Bethlehem an undulating
meadow stretches east and west, its grass starred
thick with blossoms in the days after the autumn
rains. The villagers call it the Field of Angels,
though to some it is known as the Place of the Star.
In the days of the Cæsars the turrets of Migdol
Edar, the shepherds’ watch tower, still looked down
upon the place, though shepherds had long ceased
to watch their flocks there by night.</p>

<p>Six miles to the north, behind the scarred shoulders
of the ravaged hills, lay shamed and desolate
Jerusalem. There was no longer a temple therein
whither the tribes of Israel could go up to praise and
magnify the name of Jehovah. Of all that great and
glorious Zion there remained only a place for wailing
by a ruined wall.</p>

<p>But flowers bloomed again in the red tracks of
the Roman armies, and again there were little children
to whom the horrors of that time of death were
only as a tale that is told between waking and sleeping.
When the sun shines in unclouded heavens, and
myriads of flowers wave in the sweet wind, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
lark floods his acres of sky with down-dropping
melody, what young thing will lament ruined temples
or yet vanished cities, be they never so glorious?
And so, the children were plucking the first flowers
in the Field of Angels with shouts and laughter.</p>

<p>In the dwarfed shadow of Migdol Edar sat an old
man who talked with himself in the midst of his
great silver beard, his blue eyes shining like twinkling
pools amid the frosty sedge of a winter’s morning.
“The young things crop the blossoms like
lambs,” he muttered, and stretched his withered
hand to gather a tuft of the white, starlike flowers.
Then he smiled to see a troop of little ones running
toward him fearless as the lambs to which he had
likened them.</p>

<p>First came a tall girl of ten, her clear olive cheek
shaded by a tangle of curls; she held a flower-crowned
baby in each hand. Behind her lagged three
or four smaller girls and half a score of boys, shyer
and more suspicious than their sisters.</p>

<p>“Good sir, wilt thou gather flowers in the Angel
Field?” demanded the tall girl fixing bright, questioning
eyes upon the stranger.</p>

<p>“Thou hast said truth, maiden,” answered the old
man.</p>

<p>“I have come from over seas to gather them. And
I will also tell thee one thing. Seest thou how many
blossoms grow in this low valley? There grows a
shining thought for every flower; these also would
I gather.”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. “We have found no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
shining thoughts in this field, honorable stranger,”
she said. “Here are star flowers, and blue lilies of
Israel, and anemones purple and scarlet. There are
no flowers like those of the Angel Field. But I would
that we might see the shining things which thou
hast gathered.”</p>

<p>“Sit ye down upon the grass, every child of you,”
cried the old man, his blue eyes beaming with delight,
“and I will show you my shining thoughts,
for in truth they are fairer than the flowers which
perish in the plucking. See, child, the blue lilies of
Israel how they droop and wither, and the star
flowers drop their petals like early snow; but I will
show you that which can never perish. Look you,
children, I was no taller than yon little lad—he with
the scarlet tunic; and I wandered with the shepherds
in this field—which in those days was known only
as the valley of flocks—gathering flowers and minding
the paschal lambs. They strayed not far from
their mothers. Great Jerusalem was in its latter
glory, and a marvelous bright star shone in the
heavens. Wise men there were who declared that the
star heralded the birth of Israel’s deliverer, He who
should be King of kings and Lord even of the
Romans. The shepherds talked of these things in
the night watches, and I, folded in my father’s abba,
listened between dreams.</p>

<p>“’Twas in this very spot we gathered on the night
of which I will tell you. My father, the head shepherd,
and very learned in the Psalms and Prophets,
sat silent while the others talked softly of the flocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and of the weather, which was uncommon mild for
the time of year, and of the pilgrims who had
gathered out of all the provinces to pay tribute to
the heathen emperor. The heavens were dark save
for the great star which shamed all the rest into
twinkling sparks. The young moon hung low in the
west. I saw all this from the shelter of my father’s
cloak, and was content even as the lambs which lay
close to the warm hearts of their mothers in the soft,
damp grass.</p>

<p>“Suddenly my father lifted up his great voice.
‘The Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth
keep silent before Him!’ So spake he, and the others,
marveling, held their peace. My young eyes were
just closing in a dream of peace, but they opened
wide at sound of my father’s solemn voice: ‘Behold
I will send My messenger, and he shall prepare the
way before Me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall
suddenly come to His temple. Behold, He shall come,
saith the Lord of hosts!’</p>

<p>“Then did the earth swoon and tremble—or so it
seemed to my young fancy—and the light of the
star on a sudden blazed forth with myriads of
sparkling rays, of all colors splendid and rare, and
radiance presently took shape to itself and became
the figure of a man clad in dazzling garments who
stood over against the sleeping flocks. He spoke, and
his voice was as the voice of Jordan when he rolleth
his spring floods to the sea. Every man of the shepherds
was fallen to the ground with fright; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
lay unafraid in the shelter of my father’s cloak and
saw and heard all.</p>

<p>“‘Fear not,’ said the shining one, ‘for behold, I
bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be
to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the
city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the
Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a
manger.’</p>

<p>“Then were the heavens and the silent valley and
the heights of Bethlehem filled with shining ones,
who lifted up their voices in songs the like of which
never yet fell on mortal ears. ‘Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men!’
The anthem rose and fell in glorious waves of
melody toward the star blazing in mid-heaven. The
voices passed singing into the silence, and the shining
forms, blent once more with the celestial rays of
the star, wavered for an instant before our dazzled
eyes, and were gone.</p>

<p>“My father was the first to recover himself from
that trance of wonderment. ‘Let us now go even to
Bethlehem,’ he said, ‘and see this thing which is
come to pass, which the Lord hath made known
to us.’</p>

<p>“The shepherds girt themselves to depart, and I,
creeping from the warm folds of the abba into the
chill night, followed hard after them. Being low
of stature—for I was no higher than yon little lad—I
saw a thing which the others perceived not: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
soft, damp grass was starred with snowy blossoms
both far and near where the feet of the angels had
trod. I lagged behind to gather of them a great handful.</p>

<p>“The dim light of the inn swung half-way up the
rocky steep, and there we waited in the darkness, my
young heart beating loud in my ears, whilst my
father parleyed with the keeper of the gate. ‘There
was no babe within,’ the porter said, and would
have shut the door fast in our faces but that my
father, being a man of authority and insisting that it
was even as he had said, presently pushed by him
into the khan. And indeed there was no babe in all
the place, only pilgrims lying close to the sleeping-lofts
and their beasts which crowded the courtyards.</p>

<p>“I pulled my father’s sleeve and whispered to him
that the angel said we should find the Babe lying in
a manger. And in truth, my children, when presently
we were come to the place where the great oxen were
housed from the winter’s cold, we found the young
mother and the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes
lying in a manger. He, the Salvation of Israel—the
Messiah—the Desire of Nations! These eyes gazed
upon Him in His beauty. These hands touched Him
as He lay asleep in the manger nestled in His soft
garments on the yellow straw.”</p>

<p>The tremulous voice faltered—ceased. The old
man bent forward smiling, as if once again he gazed
upon the world’s Savior asleep in His manger
cradle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>One of the girls laid a timid finger on the border
of the pilgrim’s cloak. “And was He—like other
babies?” she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Like other babies?” smiled the old man. “Yea,
verily, little one, He was fashioned in all points
even as we are—thanks be unto Jehovah! Yet was
He unlike—so wondrous fair, so heavenly beautiful
was that Babe of Bethlehem as He lay even as an
angel asleep in that humblest bed of all the earth.
The milk-white blossoms I had gathered shone faint
in the half darkness like tiny stars. I laid them at
His feet and their fragrance filled all the place as
incense.”</p>

<p>The aged shepherd looked down at the flowers in
his withered hands, his slow tears falling upon them
like holy dew. Also he murmured strange words to
which the children listened with wonder, albeit they
understood them not at all. “Behold He was in the
world, and the world was made by Him, and the
World knew him not. For by Him were all things
created that are in Heaven, and that are on earth,
visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
dominions, or principalities, or powers. These things
saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness.”</p>

<p>Then the children stole quietly away one by one,
till presently they were again at play amid the
myriad blossoms of the star flower. But the old man
rested beneath the shepherds’ tower, while the
shadows lengthened across the Field of Angels.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">SHOPPING WITH GRANDMOTHER MINTON<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Daisy Crabbe Curtis</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">“There!”</span> said Grandmother Minton, standing
stock-still in the middle of the sidewalk, all unmindful
of the fact that she was blocking the way of the
hurrying Christmas shoppers. “That child has hurt
himself! I can tell by the way he cries. Pick him up,
Susan!”</p>

<p>“O grandmother!” protested Susan. “He’s
dirty!”</p>

<p>“Bumps hurt a dirty boy just as much as a clean
one,” said Grandmother Minton.</p>

<p>Susan sighed, and with the air of a martyr lifted
the weeping urchin to his feet.</p>

<p>“It’s his forehead, poor child!” said Grandmother
Minton, gently touching a red bump on the
boy’s forehead. “Don’t cry, sonny; grandma’s got
somethin’ in her little black bag that will stop the
hurt. Here ’tis—arnica, and a nice clean handkerchief
to bind it up with,” she went on soothingly
as she worked. “Feels better already, eh? And here’s
somethin’ more to help,” she added, popping a piece
of white candy into his mouth. “That’s good for the
cry. All right, now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Grandmother, come!” whispered Susan with
scarlet cheeks.</p>

<p>She was painfully embarrassed by the curious
crowd that had collected about them.</p>

<p>“Wait till I see if he walks all right,” said the old
lady, whose face was filled with motherly anxiety.</p>

<p>“Of course he walks all right! Do come!”</p>

<p>The bystanders made way respectfully for the
little old lady and her stylishly dressed granddaughter.
Susan carefully avoided their glances, but
Grandmother Minton beamed impartially upon them
all from behind her massive-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>Would grandmother ever learn not to make herself
so conspicuous, Susan wondered. Mother might
have known that something like this would happen.
She ought not to have insisted upon Susan’s going
with grandmother to the city, and on a shopping expedition,
too! “Why,” thought Susan, glancing at
her companion, “even if grandmother wasn’t always
doing things that make people stop and look at her,
they would look at her just the same because of her
queer, old-fashioned clothes! Why will she insist
upon making them herself, and all after the same old
pattern, when father’s ready and willing to buy her
the best the stores afford? Why can’t she be like
Lillian Teller’s grandmother, always dressed in
fashion and with her hair stylishly arranged? And
why will grandmother persist in carrying that
absurd old black velvet bag everywhere she goes?
Hasn’t each of us, at some time or other, given her
a new bag?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you take one of your new bags?”
Susan had asked grandmother that very morning
when they started for the train.</p>

<p>“It seems like they’re too gorgeous,” grandmother
had said, “to hold my peppermint drops and
snacks of medicine and pennies for the children, not
to mention my packet of court-plaster and spectacle
case and bit of thread and needle. The bags you dear
people gave me just go with ’broidered handkerchiefs
and smellin’ salts and ten-dollar bills,” she
added, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>“But your black bag is so—shabby.”</p>

<p>“Tut, child, it’s an old friend grown shabby in
helpin’ me and others. Your grandfather gave it to
me before he died and I came to live at your house.
That bag’s seen good times and bad times. It’s taken
medicine to the poor and the sick. It’s carried my
clean handkerchief and collection money to church.
It’s been to weddin’s and funerals, and even carried
a set of infant’s clothes for a newborn babe of the
Raffertys’ that hadn’t a stitch to its back. Why,”
said Grandmother Minton, tenderly smoothing its
rusty drawing-strings, “you don’t know how lonesome
and homesick I’d feel without this bag!”</p>

<p>“Here we are at Trasher &amp; Brown’s,” said Susan
as they approached a great store. “Now, what’s first
on your list?” she asked briskly. “I’ll just hurry
her along,” she thought, “and maybe we can catch
the one-thirty train home.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see!” said Grandmother Minton, pulling a
worn piece of paper from her bag. “You’ll have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
read it for me, Susan. I left my readin’ specs at
home.”</p>

<p>“Peppermint sticks,” read Susan. “Candy’s in
the basement. Let’s take the elevator.”</p>

<p>“Department stores are funny,” said Grandmother
Minton, with a chuckle. “Candy, calicoes and
furniture all mixed up together.” They had reached
the candy counter, and she addressed the clerk in a
confidential tone. “Yes, I want peppermint sticks,
red and white ones. They’re the tastiest for Christmas.
What? Oh, two dozen, I should say! Let me see,
they’re for the Raffertys and Bensons and Manders
and— Best make it three dozen. What’s that,
Susan? A shopping card? You tell her how to make
it out. I’m too old-fashioned for shopping cards, I
guess. What next, Susan? Oh, yes, dolls! Nellie
Rafferty wants a yellow-haired one. Can you tell me
where the yellow-haired dolls are?” she asked the
clerk. “Nellie Rafferty’s set her heart—”</p>

<p>“I know where the dolls are, grandmother,” said
Susan hastily.</p>

<p>She did wish that grandmother would not always
take the clerks into her confidence!</p>

<p>Grandmother Minton fairly reveled in the doll
department. She went from one show case to another,
exclaiming over the pretty curls and attractive
dresses. Each doll brought for her inspection seemed
more beautiful than the last, and she could not decide
which one would best please ragged little Nellie
Rafferty. Susan was in despair! It was after twelve
o’clock and she had seen other items on grandmother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
list; a fire engine, a red cart, some brown
yarn, a girl’s coat, infant’s underwear, shoes and
stockings. She fairly gasped. Why, they would be
lucky if they reached home on the three-eighteen!</p>

<p>“Grandmother,” she suggested, “how would it be
if I bought some of the other things for you while
you’re selecting the doll? Shall I,” consulting the
list, “buy the girl’s coat and the infant’s underwear?”</p>

<p>“Why, you might, I suppose, though I’d counted
on pickin’ them out myself.”</p>

<p>“It will save time if I do it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” agreed Grandmother Minton reluctantly,
“I’ll try and tell you exactly what I want. The coat’s
to be eight-year size, and mind, it must be durable.
Like’s not, it will be handed down from one child
to another in the Benson family, and they’re such
husky young ones it’ll have to be good and stout to
stand the strain. The infant’s underwear is to be
one-year size and wool, Susan! Don’t let them give
you anything but wool.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Susan, impatient to be off. “Stay
right here, grandmother, until I come for you.”</p>

<p>It took Susan much longer than she had expected
to purchase the coat and underwear. She had to go
to the third floor for the coat, and she found a sales
clerk busy trying to please a most exacting customer,
who seemed to want to examine every coat in stock
before making a selection. When Susan’s turn came,
she hurriedly purchased a dark blue chinchilla and
then went in search of the underwear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>The afternoon shoppers were beginning to throng
the floors when Susan finally made her way back to
the toy department. That, thought Susan, must account
for the fact that, although she had nearly
reached the spot where the dolls were sold, she had
not yet caught a glimpse of a little white-haired lady
in an old-fashioned black dress and with a shabby
black velvet bag in her hand.</p>

<p>“This is the very counter where I left her,” said
Susan, with a puzzled frown. “She must be looking
at some of the show cases near by, or perhaps she has
walked a little way to look for me.”</p>

<p>She was beginning to feel anxious, for she knew
that Grandmother Minton would not be likely to
wander about the big store for herself.</p>

<p>Susan began to thread her way among the shoppers,
scanning each one sharply. At first she was
deliberate and polite, but after she had circled several
times round the toy department and still had
caught no glimpse of Grandmother Minton’s kind
old face she became desperate and pushed her way
rudely hither and thither. What had become of her
grandmother? Was she wandering helplessly round
with no one to pilot her? Would anyone notice that
she was lost and try to help her?</p>

<p>Susan stopped short in her wanderings. A possibility
that filled her with dread had flashed into
her mind. Such things had happened to other people,
she knew. Could it be that grandmother had been
taken suddenly ill and been rushed to the hospital?
What would father say? Was not Grandmother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Minton his own mother? Had he not cautioned Susan
that morning to take the best of care of her and
bring her safe home to him again? Now, she would
have to telephone and tell him—oh, she could not!
And what would mother say? And all the Raffertys
and Bensons and Manders? They worshipped
Grandmother Minton!</p>

<p>Some one grasped Susan’s arm, and the polite
voice of the floorwalker questioned her.</p>

<p>“What is it, miss? Have you lost your purse?”</p>

<p>Susan realized then that she had been wringing
her hands and that tears were in her eyes.</p>

<p>“No!” she gasped. “I—I wish I had.”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon?”</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my grandmother,” explained Susan.
“Have you seen her?”</p>

<p>The puzzled look upon the floorwalker’s face
caused Susan to be more coherent. She told him
what had happened, and he suggested that she go to
the waiting-room and rest while he went to the
office and made various inquiries. He was sure that
they would be able to find her grandmother. And,
Susan, because she was bewildered and felt faint
and weary and knew nothing better to do, acted upon
his suggestion.</p>

<p>The waiting-room was filled with the usual number
of weary shoppers, some of whom were trying
to soothe fretful children. Susan sat down in one of
the vacant chairs. It had been more than an hour
since she had missed her grandmother. Could it be
only yesterday that she had gone to her to have her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
gloves mended at the very last minute, so that she
might wear them to the concert? It seemed ages
and ages ago. Grandmother had never been out of
patience with Susan, not even during that week
when she was taking her high-school examinations
and was so snappy and cross to everyone.</p>

<p>“Oh,” thought Susan remorsefully. “I’m just
hateful to grandmother! It was wonderful of her to
help that child this morning. I’m such a proud,
stuck-up thing I’d have let him die, I suppose, rather
than lift my hand to help him. Grandmother would
help anyone who’s in need. She’d give her last
cent to—”</p>

<p>“There,” said a cheery voice, “you look better!
Wasn’t it lucky I was near by when you felt faint?”</p>

<p>Susan turned sharply and her eyes opened wide.
There, bending solicitously over a woman who lay
on the divan, was grandmother! She had in her hand
one of the little bottles from her black bag and was
bathing and rubbing the sick woman’s forehead.
Susan held her breath and drew near. How infinitely
dear grandmother was! She had taken off
her coat and looked so quaint and grandmotherly in
her fitted basque and softly shirred skirt. How suitably
the close little bonnet framed the white hair,
plump face and kind blue eyes!</p>

<p>Susan’s gaze wandered to the woman to whom her
grandmother was ministering. She was so stylishly
gowned that Susan was astonished when she saw her
face. It was much wrinkled and, in spite of the faint
touch of rouge on the cheeks, looked ghastly. “She’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
old,” thought Susan, “in spite of her stylish, young-looking
clothes. Why, she must be older than grandmother!
Maybe she’s a grandmother, too, but she
doesn’t look like a comfortable one. <i>She’d</i> never
go into the kitchen and make doughnuts for me and
mince pie for Brother Jack. She’d never help a dirty
child that had hurt himself!”</p>

<p>“Grandmother!” called Susan softly.</p>

<p>“Well, Sue, child,” said Grandmother Minton,
with a welcoming smile, “so you’ve come for me! I
aimed to get back to the doll counter before you
came, but this lady was taken faint right near where
I was, and of course, I came here with her. Lan’s
sake child, you look pale yourself! Sit right down
in this chair. I’ll have to rub your forehead, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right now that I’ve found you. Oh, grandmother,
I thought you were lost!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I was comin’ right back, Sue. Here’s
my handkerchief. There! I guess,” said Grandmother
Minton, with a smile, as she fumbled in her
black bag, “if you are going to cry, I’ll have to
give you a candy drop like I gave that little boy
this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Do,” said Susan, laughing through her tears,
“and get it from the bottom of your little black bag,
grandmother!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> feet eleven of vigorous, well-fed, clean-shaven
humanity, a little past the middle age, enveloped in
a fur-lined overcoat, and carrying a handsome dress-suit
case; this was John James Alston of New York,
a hard-headed, hard-hearted old bachelor, with no
kith or kin in the world, that he knew. There might
be a few distant cousins or so, somewhere out Connecticut
way; he didn’t know or care. He had worked
his way in the world himself, and made a moderate
fortune, and knew how to take care of it. What more
did a man want?</p>

<p>The Pullman porters had eyed him respectfully,
at intervals, all the way from New York: his air and
apparel indicated wealth, and his manner commanded
instant obedience. Nothing in his firm-set
mouth, the poise of his head, his cool dignity, betrayed
the fact that the habits of a lifetime were
attacked and in danger of being carried by assault.
And the besieger was a mite of a four-year-old girl,
all daintiness and captivating ways, whose mother
occupied a near-by chair in the Pullman car. The
little miss persisted in hovering about the cold, quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
gentleman and attracting his attention. John James
Alston rather liked children, when they were well-behaved;
and when mama said, “No, no,” and drew
the intruder away, the dainty red lips quivered. In
dread of an outburst,—John James disliked crying
children—he suddenly emerged from his shell.</p>

<p>“Pray let her come, madam; I shall enjoy it,” was
what he said. And directly he found himself taken
possession of in the most astonishing way, and made
the recipient of all manner of Christmas confidences.</p>

<p>“You goin’ home for Kis’mus?” she said, cuddling
into his lap. Finding he had no friends to
visit, no little girls to play with, she said she was
“drefful sorry.” Then she told him about the delights
of “gwanpa’s” when all the uncles and aunts
and cousins were assembled. When she got out at
Stonington, he felt a great loss. And now, as he
walked the platform at the Junction, waiting for
another train, he was somehow conscious of a
strange and unusual loneliness. It was two days before
Christmas. All day he had seen jubilant family
groups at stations welcoming their arriving relatives;
all day he had heard talk of home-coming and
Christmas gifts among children and grown-ups on
the train. John James Alston, I am sorry to say,
became decidedly cross. “I was stupid,” he told
himself, “to start anywhere on business at this
season. I might just as well have waited till next
week, and avoided all this nonsense.” And he wished
himself back again in his cozy bachelor apartments
in New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>His meditations had carried him thus far when
somebody seized his hands. “Aren’t you Uncle John
from the West?” cried a girl’s voice. And a boy’s
chimed in: “Of course it’s Uncle John! How do you
do, Uncle John?” Then childish accents uttered, “I
know’d him by his picshur!” And hurrying across
the platform, a stout, cheerful woman pushed the
children aside, crying, “John Damon! And you
wrote you didn’t think you could come!” Then she
shook him by both hands and kissed him impulsively.</p>

<p>John James Alston caught his breath. The woman
was so wholesome and hearty, though she <i>did</i> wear a
thick shawl and an unfashionable bonnet, that—well,
he collected himself and managed to say,
“Madam, there’s a mistake”; but she didn’t hear
or pay the slightest attention to what he said.</p>

<p>“Billy, bring the horse around, quick,” she commanded.
“It’s ten minutes before the other train
comes. We’ll just have time to get away. Old
Griggs’ll never get over being scared of the cars,”
with a smile to John James. “Dolly, don’t hang on
to your uncle so. Maidie, can’t you get her away?”</p>

<p>“Want my nuncle to carry me,” declared Dolly,
the smallest girl, clinging to John James’s immaculate
glove. He looked down. The face that
looked up was dimpling and sweet in its worsted
hood, and golden curls peeped out all around it. He
never was able to explain the impulse that moved
him, and what followed was a wonderment to him
all his life; but the protest died on his lips, and he
picked up the smallest girl and hugged her. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
and there he shook off John James Alston as he
left the dismal Junction platform, and, as “Uncle
John” from the West, submitted to be led to the
waiting carryall.</p>

<p>“Get right in on the back seat,” said the cheerful
woman. “Maidie, you an’ Dolly can sit back
there, too. I’ll drive. Or, no—Billy can drive.”
Sarah’s grammar was not quite up to the mark but
you can hear the like of it in the country any day.</p>

<p>They piled in jubilantly and pulled up the buffalo-robes.
John James’s dress-suit case was in the way,
and he told Billy to put his feet right on it and never
mind!</p>

<p>“Won’t your brother Asher be glad to see you!”
exclaimed the woman. “Le’ ’s see—it’s full ten
years, if ’tis a day, sence you came East. How is
everything in Cheyenne?”</p>

<p>John James assured her that Cheyenne was all
right.</p>

<p>“You must ’a’ be’n lonesome sence Annie died.
Pity you never had any children. Home wouldn’t be
home to me without children.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said John James.</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose you remember Maidie—she was a
baby when you saw her last.” John said he hardly
remembered Maidie. “An’ Billy—he’s ten; and
Dolly, four—they’ve come sence you left us. They’re
both mine.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve a little brother, Aunt Sarah,” put in
Maidie.</p>

<p>“Yes, Asher an’ Mary’s had both sorrow an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
joy,” said the cheerful woman, more soberly.
“They lost a little girl, but they have a little two-year-old
boy. His name’s John, after you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so I’ve a namesake,” said John James. He
tried to get his bearings, and kept his ears open for
names and facts. But reflection was also at work; he
remembered that the day after to-morrow was
Christmas, and the uncle from the West had not one
Christmas gift for his namesake or the family. He
realized with a sudden alarm that he had to do
something, and do it quickly.</p>

<p>“By the way, is there a long-distance telephone
round here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; down at the depot,” said Billy, pulling
up. “Want I should drive back?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll just run over there, myself,” said John
James. “You keep old Griggs round the corner here.
I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p>He made haste across the wide country square.
Aunt Sarah, watching him, said, “He’s spry, ain’t
he?” and then, “I guess he’s well off. That coat
didn’t cost no small sum.”</p>

<p>John James found the telephone, and got connections
with a Boston business man whom he knew
well. Before he had talked three minutes, the business
man’s hair began to rise on his head, and he
interrupted to inquire if John James was really
himself or another. With great irritation, John
James replied in hasty language, and bade him confine
his attention to the subject in hand. He talked
for fully ten minutes. At the end he was assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
that his order was received and would be duly
honored.</p>

<p>“And rush it!” was John James’s parting injunction
as he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>The station-master eyed him queerly as he came
out. “Le’ ’s see—you look like John Damon used to—not
exactly, either—more cityfied! But you <i>be</i> him,
ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“That’s what they call me,” replied John, and
submitted to be greeted as an old friend in the jolliest
way possible. He also acquired some new facts.</p>

<p>“Your father’s feeble—very feeble,” said the
man. “I’m glad you were able to come home to
spend Christmas with him.”</p>

<p>“I find it hard to leave my affairs,” soberly said
John James.</p>

<p>“They said you wrote so. Wal, you’ll find Asher
some grayer, but jolly still. He’s got the mor’gidge
all paid off but five hundred or so. He was talkin’ of
old times only t’other day, and how much you boys
used to think of each other. D’ye rember how he
once took the whippin’ ’twas meant for you, an’
never said nothin’?”</p>

<p>“I remember a good many things,” said John
James as he left him, and in a few minutes again
took his place in the carryall.</p>

<p>He was becoming more and more interested in the
family history which “Aunt Sarah” continued to
give him, when, at last, the carryall turned up a
farm-house lane, and they saw a woman step uncertainly
to the side door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“There’s Mary,” said Aunt Sarah, and the children
began to shout: “Here’s Uncle John!”</p>

<p>Asher Damon, the first to respond to the summons,
stepped out of the door, a typical New England
farmer, in his shirt-sleeves and overalls.</p>

<p>“By Jinks, this is great!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>John James, descending, received and returned
his vigorous hand-grip; kissed Mary, his sister-in-law;
was rushed at and embraced by three strange
women who addressed him as “Cousin John.” Then
they all stood in a group and talked at once. “But
come in!” said Asher suddenly—“come in and see
father. He’ll be overjoyed. He’s insisted on Sarah
goin’ to the depot every day for a week, on the
chance of your comin’.” So John James went in to
see his father.</p>

<p>He trembled a little under the keen and searching
gaze of the old man, who got up and took him by
both shoulders, turning his face to the light.</p>

<p>“You’re changed, boy, changed!” he said tremulously.
“Seems like you’re steadier, graver. But
you’ve lost your wife Annie. It’s natural, after all.
It’s a good deal to me to see you to-day.”</p>

<p>And John James Alston suddenly shrank into
himself and felt like the impostor he was.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think he’s changed—a little,” said
Asher’s wife, surveying him closely. “But it’s ten
years; and people and things don’t stand still.
There’s the baby, your namesake, John.”</p>

<p>She ran into the bedroom at a child’s cry and
brought out a round-faced, curly-haired two-year-old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
whom she deposited on Uncle John’s knee. He
said, “Great Scott!” and clutched the new burden
awkwardly, conscious of extreme confusion of
mind.</p>

<p>“That comes of not being used to children,” cried
Mrs. Sarah, merrily, catching at the child. “Here,
Mary; he’s not safe. John’s got to have some lessons
in baby-tending.” And all the women laughed.</p>

<p>If John James Alston ever fancied a country life
lacking in variety, he changed his mind from that
day. They took him out to see the cattle, and Asher
dwelt on their strong points. He was made to take
note of the rakish, upward curve in the noses of the
Berkshire hogs, and saw the prize pullets and the
Toulouse geese. He heard about the rotation of
crops. And though he tried his best to say the right
thing at the right moment, he saw one and another
look at him sometimes in a puzzled way that made
his blood run cold. And this was a queer sensation
for the dignified, self-possessed John J. Alston of
New York.</p>

<p>That night he was shown to the best upstairs bedroom;
there was just enough space for the mountainous
bed, the bureau, washstand, and one chair. He
turned back the heavy coverlets and stood regarding
the swelling height before him. “Great Scott!”
he murmured. “I never slept in a feather-bed in my
life. Wonder how far I shall sink down.”</p>

<p>When he was in, and the pillows heaped around
him, he began to grow deliciously warm. “I don’t
care—I’m a rank impostor, I know, but I’ll see this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
thing through, now I’ve begun. I feel uncommonly
like a boy.” And he laughed outright.</p>

<p>The next day, to be safe, he devoted himself to the
children, to the great relief of their busy mothers;
and before night, Maidie, Billy, and Dolly were his
devoted lovers. There were finger-marks on his
shirt-front and wrinkles in his coat, due to his little
namesake, who was quite ready to howl when
separated from his Uncle John. Early in the day he
took Asher aside and inquired about the express accommodations,
intimating that he expected a Christmas
shipment by express from Boston.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” said Asher. “We’ll send up at
five o’clock; the last express gets in then.” And he
felt a little curiosity, for the real John Damon was
not wont to be over-generous.</p>

<p>More than once that day did John James wonder
what had become of his other self, the city-man
Alston, whom he had left on the station platform.
John James was having the time of his life. Anybody
who has ever enjoyed a country Christmas in
a farm-house full of peace, good-will, and happy
relatives will understand all about it. At dark Asher
came in. “John!” said he. “You and Billy’ll jes’
have to go down to the depot—we’re hustlin’ to get
the chores done.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said John James. “Billy, don’t you
want to go?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Billy. “I’ll be through with these
pigs in a jiffy, an’ I’ll be right along. You can be
harnessing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>John James went out to the barn. He had never
harnessed a horse in his life. He led out old Griggs,
who marched deliberately to the water-trough and
plunged his nose in.</p>

<p>John James took down a headstall at random, and
old Griggs understood in about two minutes that he
had to deal with inexperience, and refusing the bit,
led the city-man a dance all over the barn floor. Then
Billy came in.</p>

<p>“Here—hello!” said he. “What you doing with
that work-harness, Uncle John? Here’s the right
one. An’ the collar goes on first, anyway. Why,
you’ve forgotten how to harness! Hi, you old rascal,
stand still!”</p>

<p>John James had the mortification of beholding
the ten-year-old corner old Griggs and equip him
with the necessary rigging in no time at all.</p>

<p>“I thought you had a good many horses in your
business, uncle,” said Billy, fastening one of the
traces, while his “uncle” tried the other.</p>

<p>“The men do a good deal of the harnessing,”
desperately said John James at a venture.</p>

<p>The box was at the station. It was decidedly a big
box. It took John James and the depot-man to get
it into the wagon. When the wagon, much heavier
now, slid upon the horse’s hocks, going down a steep
incline on the return trip, there were prancings, suddenly
uplifted iron heels, then a furious run.</p>

<p>Billy held on valiantly, and rebuked old Griggs
in vociferous accents; while John James, acknowledging
the master-hand, sat still and looked for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
soft place to fall in. Having at last pulled up, Billy
got out to investigate.</p>

<p>“Well, I vow, Uncle John, if you didn’t forget to
buckle the britchen-strap on your side!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>And John James, with a dreadful sense of mortification,
blushed scarlet under cover of the dark.</p>

<p>By the time they got home the snow was falling
quietly and steadily, and it increased as the night
wore on.</p>

<p>Late at night, after the household were abed,
John James and Asher opened the box. It was a
surprise indeed—that box! The Boston man had fulfilled
his commission admirably, and John James
chuckled as he pulled out one article after another.</p>

<p>“We gener’ly have our presents on our plates or
chairs at breakfast,” observed Asher. “The women-folks
put ’em here, as you see,” indicating the table
in the living-room with its modest gifts. “The children
hang their stockings by the fireplace; they like
the fun of pullin’ things out.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s something for little John,” said
John James, unwrapping a gorgeous drum and a
stunning horse with “truly” hair all over him.
“And here, just undo that long box, Asher. Here
are some good books for the children.”</p>

<p>Asher opened the long pasteboard box. “Land
o’ Goshen!” said he, “I never see sech a doll. Looks
like an angel gone to sleep.”</p>

<p>“That’s for Dolly; won’t she squeal!” said John
James. “Billy skates, doesn’t he? These will fit him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
I hope—and here’s a pair for Maidie. This—what’s
this? It’s labeled ‘for the girl.’” He tore a hole in
the paper. “Oh, a dress. That’s for Maidie, too.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a white knitted shawl for—whom? You
know best about the women-folks. I had to just guess
at it. Here’s some fancy embroidered collars, and
stuff of that sort.”</p>

<p>“Mary would like the shawl, and Sarah the collars,”
said Asher, slowly.</p>

<p>“All right, put ’em there. Ah ha, now, this is the
thing! Try on these rubber boots, Asher!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, John,” said Asher, resolutely; “you
jest go slow! Be you made of gold, or what? These
things must ’a’ cost a mint o’ money!”</p>

<p>John James sat back on his heels and thought a
moment. “I can afford it easily; I have been greatly
prospered,” said he.</p>

<p>“Wal, you’re lucky—and this is a reg’lar windfall,”
said Asher, getting into the boots. John James
laughed, slapping him on the back.</p>

<p>“Perfect fit. They’re yours, Asher. Now lend a
hand. A man’s long dressing-gown—that’s for father!”</p>

<p>“He won’t know how to act,” said Asher.</p>

<p>“Half a dozen boxes of candy—hope nobody will
get ill from them,” went on John James, still investigating.
“Here’s—oh, undo this carefully—a fur
tippet for Mary!”</p>

<p>“Great snakes!” said Asher, handling it with
reverence. “I never see no sech fur as this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a warm one, I hope,” said John, from
the depths of the box.</p>

<p>He brought out mittens for the children, a stunning
suit for little John, dresses for Sarah, Mary,
and the cousins, more books, mechanical toys that
set Asher laughing as if he never would stop.</p>

<p>Asher gazed around the kitchen, which looked like
a museum.</p>

<p>“I never see sech a sight,” said he; “I’m sort o’
bewildered. <i>Is</i> this you an’ me, or some other fellows?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out if you don’t wake up and put all
these things on the plates and chairs where they
belong. Asher, we must clear up these wrappings.
Hold on!—here’s something we overlooked.” He
picked up a small box containing four tiny boxes.</p>

<p>“Rings for the children, by jiminy!” said Asher,
looking over his shoulder. “Lucky we didn’t cram
it into the kindlin’s.”</p>

<p>It was one o’clock before they got to bed; and it
seemed as if they were only just asleep before the
seven-o’clock alarm went off, and waked them up
to a world of snow.</p>

<p>They slept later than usual, but there was a tremendous
hustling in that house, once they were
fairly awake. When all were dressed and had come
down, the shrieks of the children and their own curiosity
made it nearly impossible for the women to
get breakfast. It was one of their Christmas rules
that no gift on the table should be taken up till all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
were at the board. But Dolly, with low “oh’s” and
“ah’s” of delight, touched softly the pink toes and
hands of the big “sleeping beauty” in her chair;
for the box was too big to go on the table. All their
chairs were full, and the steaming breakfast cooled
before the jubilant household were ready to eat.</p>

<p>Asher opened his fine new pocket-book, and seeing
a piece of paper in it, took it out, stared, put it back,
looked at it again with a dazed expression, and got
up, overturning his chair. His old father looked up
from the warm dressing-gown they had put on him,
and which he was smoothing like a pleased child.</p>

<p>“What ails ye, Asher?” asked the old man.</p>

<p>“Sit down, man, sit down!” said John James in
an undertone, picking up the chair.</p>

<p>“Lawsee, but I can’t! John, this is too much!
Why, John, I never heard—”</p>

<p>“Oh, keep quiet, Asher! Sit down, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Father, this is a cashier’s draft on a Boston
bank for five hundred an’ fifty dollars. It pays the
last o’ the mor’gidge an’ interest, father! John, I
can’t take it—after all this!” said Asher, waving
his hands widely abroad at the gifts around him.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Asher!—yes, you will, too. Man, I
never had such fun in my life before! Pour him some
coffee, somebody, please.”</p>

<p>“John!” said Asher, gripping his hand hard and
choking.</p>

<p>“You see, Asher, I thought ’twas high time you
got paid off for that whipping you took for me long
ago, when I deserved it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, thunder!” said Asher, unable to speak another
word.</p>

<p>They passed the day quietly together, and it
seemed to John James that he never ate so tender a
turkey, such exquisitely seasoned vegetables. The
plum-pudding with its burning sauce capped the
whole, and left them with serene souls.</p>

<p>When dark settled down, and the farm “chores”
were done, candles and lamps lit the low-ceiled, comfortable
old rooms, and with mirth and jollity they
played Christmas games. John James had forgotten
all about his other self—the city-man left on the
depot platform. His oldest acquaintance wouldn’t
have known him as he “marched to Jerusalem,”
with his thick, grayish hair rumpled all over his
head, or spun the tin pie-plate on the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>But suddenly there came a sound of bells, the
tramp of a horse on the cleared path at the side
door.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s come in this snow,” said Asher, going
to the door. They all pressed forward to see.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare! Hello! Here ye all are!” cried
a voice. “Ye didn’t expect me, I’ll be bound. I concluded
to come, after all. I was snowed in last night,
or I should’a’ got here this mornin’. Merry Christmas
to all of ye!”</p>

<p>It was the <i>real</i> John Damon, covered with snow,
hungry but jolly. Behind him the driver tugged his
bag. John James Alston’s heart gave a great bound,
then sunk to the depths of his boots. Amid the
amazed silence of the whole family, the real and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the false John Damon confronted each other.</p>

<p>“What—what—who’s this?” stammered the newcomer,
recognizing the resemblance in a moment,
yet unable at once to grasp the astounding audacity
of this stranger’s performance. As for the family,
they needed but to see the two men together in order
to know them apart. In the agitation of the moment,
I am afraid the welcome they gave brother John
from the West lacked the proper warmth.</p>

<p>John James Alston understood that it was “up
to him” to explain. And it was the cool and resourceful
city-man, his dignity still touched with the heart-warm
jollity of the country John James, who rose to
the occasion, and somehow won all hearts to him
anew in the utterance of his first few sentences.</p>

<p>“Mr. Damon,” he said, “Asher, my brother,”—he
put his hand on Asher’s shoulder and kept it
there,—“and all you, my dear, newfound friends, I
have to ask your pardon for usurping a position that
does not belong to me. I am John J. Alston of New
York. I have always been a lonely man. I never married,
and have no family ties. I think I never realized
how lonely I was until, coming up into this section
on business, I heard on every side talk of Christmas,
and saw at every station Christmas meetings and
greetings, and people going home. Five apartment
rooms make my home,” he added with a smile.
“While I waited for my train at the Junction, these
children claimed me as their uncle, and Sarah here
saluted me as her brother.” Sarah looked uncomfortable.
“It was very pleasant, and in an unguarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
moment I yielded to temptation and came home with
them. I didn’t know there were such kind-hearted
people alive. I never have had such a good time in
my life. May I hope you’ll all pardon me, and let
me be a second Uncle John to the end of the chapter?”</p>

<p>Half-way through his little oration he felt Maidie’s
hand slip shyly into his. Billy stood close behind
him; little John, who had resented being put
down, tried to climb up his leg; and Dolly, with her
curly-haired beauty in one arm, hung to him whenever
she could get a hold. Plainly John James “filled
the bill” with them.</p>

<p>“Huh! well! see that now! <i>My</i> nose’s out of
joint,” said the Western Uncle John, with a laugh,
indicating the children. “I never heard of a thing
like this—never. It’s a most astonishing thing—really,
now. But I can’t blame you.” He offered his
hand to John James. “I don’t see but we’ll have to
get acquainted. It’s a great comfort, too, to know
that I resemble such a good-looking man!” He scrutinized
John James closely. “It almost reconciles
me to the loss of my turkey dinner.”</p>

<p>“But you shan’t lose it!” protested Aunt Sarah,
amid the babel of tongues wherewith they welcomed
the Western uncle afresh, and sought to assure John
James of their entire forgiveness and acceptance of
him as one of the family. And straightway one of
the cousins dragged Uncle John away to the table,
with intent to satisfy his hunger, and incidentally
to lay before him a history of the whole affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Later on, the business of Christmas enjoyment
was resumed with—if possible—greater zest than
ever; and when, at a shockingly late hour, John
James repaired to the mountainous bed in the little
room, he knew that peace and good-will were more
than mere names, and that he never should repent
of the audacious performance which had won him
a whole family of country relatives. And while just
dropping off to sleep, it came to him that it would
be well to look up those Connecticut cousins before
next Christmas, and find out what they were like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was such a very little boy and everything about
him was pale—hair, eyes, ears, everything. But even
though his face was so peaked, his big ears were
what you noticed first, and we soon discovered that
he could move them most surprisingly—backward
and forward. This was something that none of the
rest of us could do. It was for this reason probably
that we began calling him Bunny Face.</p>

<p>He didn’t have a family, like other children. I
don’t know to this day where he came from, but
he lived with a woman that he called aunt, whenever
he called her anything. But she played very little
part in his life, and some folks said that she wasn’t
his aunt at all. But our mothers said that this was
being inquisitive and told us never, never to say
such a thing to Bunny Face. But the grown-ups
always stopped talking about it when we were
around, so of course we knew there was some more
which they never would tell us. Anyway, the aunt’s
name was Katie Duckworth, and she had it painted
in big letters over her dry-goods store downtown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
It was a tiny little store and crowded and dark inside.
She was sort of blind and never could find the
things that your mother sent you there to buy. There
were some folks who said she wasn’t very bright.
But to this day, whenever I smell gingham it makes
me think of Katie Duckworth and her little dry-goods
store.</p>

<p>Although they seemed to get along all right,
Bunny Face and his aunt never fixed up in their
best clothes and went off together a-hold of hands,
as the rest of us did with our mothers or our aunts.
But then poor Bunny Face didn’t have any other
clothes; though, goodness knows, that didn’t worry
him at all. His aunt never sent him to Sunday
school and didn’t bother at all when the teacher told
her that he played truant. But Bunny Face was
good-natured; and if you had ever seen a smile start
on his face and spread all over it till it made his
ears wiggle, you would have smiled, too, no matter
what.</p>

<p>“Why is a goblin, or why isn’t a goblin?” He was
fond of asking the rest of us questions like that,
and then he would laugh and laugh, just as if he
knew the answer himself. He often told us long
stories about places he’d been and queer things he’d
done, and though we knew that they had never really
happened, we didn’t care.</p>

<p>In school he wasn’t any good at all; just sat and
looked out of the window and scratched things with
his jackknife. He spoiled his books and spilled ink
on the floor, but he loved big dictionary words and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
knew lots of them, so sometimes we didn’t know
just what he was talking about. He played truant
oftener than any of the big boys; maybe it was because
it was so easy for him to get away, being so
small he could slip out before teacher noticed.</p>

<p>But the school house janitor—Old Crab, we called
him—was always on the lookout for Bunny Face.
He was really a terrible person, evil and hateful.
He hobbled on one crutch and lived in a battered old
shanty by the dump. You see, he didn’t have a wife—dead
or something; but the shanty was just full
of children. They were all sizes and all starved
looking—and bad too.</p>

<p>Bunny Face knew the woods all about as most children
knew their own back lot, and he used to walk
miles and miles through any kind of weather, for,
as he said, things happened in the woods and there
were water spirits down in the creek. He kept track
of all the little animals, and he knew what trees had
squirrels living in them and where certain birds
had their nests. But when he told about them the
creatures that lived in the woods seemed exactly like
folks. Well, late one afternoon on his way home,
when he’d been prowling around all day, he heard
a most awful racket, then barking. And suddenly
a Maltese cat flattened itself and wiggled under the
fence and shot up a tree. Bunny Face looked over
the fence into the garden. Yes, there was the very
dog, only he was tied. Right that minute an old man
came out and said “Well, well,” and “What, what,”
the way old people do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Is she yours?” Bunny Face pointed up in the
branches.</p>

<p>“No, sonny,” answered the old man.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll get her then,” said Bunny Face; and
he began to coax “Nice kitty, nice kitty” till the cat
came down within reach. She was a poor, thin thing
with eager eyes and shabby ears. But he thought
that she had a fine coat.</p>

<p>“Let’s give her some supper,” said the old man.</p>

<p>So that is the way it came about that Bunny Face
and the Parson started being friends.</p>

<p>Right away they began to get acquainted there in
the kitchen while the cat lapped milk, and the Parson
invited Bunny Face to stay to supper. He said
that he could, all right; so that was settled and they
went into the other room to sit by the fire till suppertime.</p>

<p>“Think I’ll take my cat,” said Bunny Face.</p>

<p>“Why not call her Agnes, after my old horse?”
said the Parson.</p>

<p>And so the Maltese cat was named Agnes.</p>

<p>It was nice and warm in the Parson’s house, and
there were lots of things to ask questions about.
There were two big creaking chairs in front of the
fire, and the old man sat in one and Bunny Face sat
in the other and held Agnes on his lap. Finally the
cat went to sleep, and they talked. Bunny Face told
his new friend about a lot of things. And the Parson
told about his horse that he had had once and about
the dog that had barked at Agnes.</p>

<p>Just then a little bell rang, and the Parson said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
that supper was ready. They went out and washed
their hands under the pump, then sat down to the
table in the kitchen, where there was an old lady.
The Parson said that she was his sister and then
he told her who Bunny Face was. After that the old
man said a grace and they ate little biscuits with
honey and different things and Bunny Face enjoyed
himself very much indeed. But the old lady wasn’t a
bit like anyone he had ever seen before, because her
face was different. And when Bunny Face started
home she tied his muffler and asked if he was warm
enough. He took Agnes with him and said, yes, he’d
come again. And the Parson stood in the door and
held the lamp up over his head till Bunny Face got
’way down the road.</p>

<p>The next morning there was snow on the ground,
and the children at school began to talk about Christmas.
And very soon all the shops fixed up their show
windows with Christmas things. But Hampton’s
Toy Shop was the finest. Everyone thought so, and
each day we were nearly late at school because we
stood and looked in so long. Old Mrs. Hampton always
clerked with a black satin apron on and a
scoopy black hat, and she wore thick glasses to look
at the price with. Though the children didn’t buy,
they always asked how much everything was.</p>

<p>One day Bunny Face followed some of the other
children in, and there hanging up on the wall he saw
a picture. It showed Santa Claus himself, pack and
all, coming out of a little house with a bright green
door and a red chimney. But there was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
about that picture that made him feel very queer.
Finally he knew what it was. It was the trees. You
see, he knew exactly where those big, tall pine trees
were, out on Clark’s road. He was sure of it. But
he’d find out for himself. Anyway there wouldn’t
be a picture of Santa Claus’ house if he really didn’t
have one, and why wouldn’t it be out on Clark’s road
anyway? He kept on thinking about it all the morning.</p>

<p>So that afternoon he played truant again. It was
a cold day, and the snowflakes nipped you on the
cheeks as they flew past, but Bunny Face pulled
down his cap and hurried on. He scrambled over
fences and took all the short cuts across the snowy
fields that led off toward Clark’s road. It was a long
way to go on such a cold day, but he kept saying to
himself what fun it would be when he got there to
knock on Santa Claus’ door. Then he’d wait and
Santa Claus would say “Come in”—just like that,
and open would pop the door and there he, Bunny
Face, would be standing. Of course he’d tell Santa
Claus right away who he was, and Santa Claus
would probably say, “Stay to supper, won’t you?”
Then he’d see all the toys that were ready for
Christmas, and may be Santa Claus would say,
“Help yourself, Bunny Face; pick out something
nice.”</p>

<p>Now the road curves just before you come to those
tall pines, and Bunny Face decided to close his eyes
and take five hundred steps, then open them quick,
for there he’d be exactly in front of Santa Claus’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
house. It kept him busy counting steps, and he got
mixed up and maybe he cheated a little to make five
hundred come sooner, but finally it was four hundred
and ninety-eight, then four hundred and ninety-nine.
Then he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>The wind was whistling through the branches and
blowing the snow in cloudy rings under the tall
black trees. But no little Santa Claus’ house with a
green door and red chimney was standing there.
Bunny Face couldn’t see a house anywhere. Then
he knew how cold he was, and his feet didn’t <i>feel</i>
at all. He rubbed his eyes, for this was the place.
Those were the very trees surely. Then he tried to
think of all the other tall pine trees that he knew. Of
course, maybe he had made a mistake; he would look
at Mrs. Hampton’s picture again tomorrow. There
was nothing to do now but to go back across the cold,
white fields. He tried not to think about eating supper
with Santa Claus and choosing a present for
himself.</p>

<p>It seemed a thousand times farther going back
than it had coming; indeed he thought that he never,
<i>never</i> would get there. But at last, just as the street
lights were coming on, he opened the door of Katie
Duckworth’s store and dragged himself over to the
stove.</p>

<p>But my, how his heart jumped! For there, stretching
out and looking very long, was Agnes fast asleep
under the stove. He’d somehow forgotten about
Agnes today, but he pulled her out and held her
tight. How soft and warm and gentle she was!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>Katie Duckworth was selling red mittens to a
woman who said they were for Christmas, and she
bought hair ribbons and handkerchiefs and a lot
more presents before she left. Bunny Face saw that
his aunt had been putting Christmas trimmings
around the store while he was away. It looked quite
fine. But it seemed queer, too, that she’d never talked
about Christmas.</p>

<p>It seemed to Bunny Face that every single child
had money to spend—for presents for other folks,
mind you. This was all new to Bunny Face, for he
had supposed that Santa Claus brought all the presents
to everybody.</p>

<p>So Bunny Face concluded that he must have some
Christmas secrets too. He’d give presents to people
himself and have surprises and whisper like other
folks. But how about the presents—what were they
to be? That puzzled him. He sat by the stove and
thought and thought. The next day he went for a
walk. And after a while he found himself on the
last street of the town just where the fields began.
Ahead were the snowy woods and the frozen creek.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll look for the pine trees,” said Bunny
Face. This had been in his head all the time, and
he only said that to surprise himself. If he could only
really find Santa Claus he’d be all right. Then he’d
explain that all he had was Agnes, and she wasn’t
a Christmas present to be given away. And he knew
that there was no other way out of it; he must find
him. So that day he visited all the pine trees that
were anywhere about. But not under one of them did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
he find a house, let alone Santa Claus’ house.</p>

<p>He knew that it must be getting late, for the sun
was big and red and low down behind things. He
was coming to the dump, which was mostly covered
with snow, but the janitor’s shanty looked black and
gloomy and only a little thin blue smoke was coming
out of the chimney.</p>

<p>Suddenly a snowball whizzed past his head, and
he saw the biggest dump child duck behind the corner;
then snowballs began coming from every way,
for the other dump children had come out. After a
while they got tired and began to talk. Bunny Face
started it by asking if they knew where Santa Claus’
house was. The real little dump children stared, but
the big ones looked ugly.</p>

<p>“Santy Claus your granny!” they said. “Who put
that in your head? Anyway if there was one, our
old man would take his shotgun to him.”</p>

<p>As Bunny Face trudged on, it came to him that
there would be other folks beside himself who would
not get presents on Christmas. It made him feel a
little better to count them.</p>

<p>“First,” he said, “there’s me; second, Agnes;
next, the dump children. Let’s see—fourth, the janitor,
of course. And fifth?” He might as well use up
all his fingers. “Fifth—Madam Iceberg. Yes, that
was a good one, for she wouldn’t get presents or
give them.”</p>

<p>But you don’t know who Madam Iceberg was. She
was the most-wondered-about person anywhere
around. Long ago she used to go traveling, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
have visitors from away off come to see her. At
those times the big house would be lighted from top
to bottom, with all sorts of things going on. Then
she was really beautiful to look at. But mercy me,
how she’d gone off these last years! Now her hair
was far too yellow and her cheeks far too pink and
her eyes were—uneasy.</p>

<p>There were No Trespassing signs all over her
place; and rather than buy at any of our stores, she
used to drive every day in her high carriage over
to the next town and do all of her shopping there.
So you can see that she wasn’t at all friendly with
any of us thereabout.</p>

<p>Of course little Bunny Face had never talked to
her, but he felt sure Santa Claus wouldn’t risk
bothering much around her chimneys.</p>

<p>So with his head filled with these thoughts he
went on till he came to the Parson’s little white
house. Bunny Face decided to knock on the door and
ask how the dog was. And the door was quickly
opened by the Parson himself, who invited him
right in.</p>

<p>And the Parson’s sister got him some supper, and
he sat on a little stool by the fire and ate it while
he told them about hunting for Santa Claus’ house.
Then Bunny Face said that he knew five folks that
wouldn’t have any Christmas, yes, sir. “Me,” he
said, “Agnes, the dump children, the janitor, and
Madam Iceberg.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe not,” said the Parson.</p>

<p>Then he talked about something else, and asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Bunny Face if he had ever heard the Christmas
Story. As Bunny Face didn’t know that there was
one, he shook his head. So the Parson opened a
book and turned pages, then read: “‘And there were
in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.’”</p>

<p>When it was finished the Parson closed the book,
saying: “It’s the Spirit of Christmas, sonny—the
Spirit of Christmas that the world needs.”</p>

<p>Bunny Face liked the idea. Spirits were a sort of
ghosts or goblins; he knew that much. Not like
Santa Claus at all—fat and pink, but different. He’d
rather think that the Spirit was like a beautiful lady,
a sort of fairy. So that’s what he was thinking
about one day coming home from school, when he
heard the sound of sleigh bells behind him. He
turned around and waited, for hopping bobs in
those days was a great sport with the children. But
it wasn’t a bobsled at all, but Madam Iceberg’s fine
green sleigh, fur rugs and all.</p>

<p>“Who’s afraid?” said Bunny Face to himself as
the sleigh glided past him, and he hopped lightly on
behind, to the surprise of all the people in the street.</p>

<p>On they went, Bunny Face, holding on for dear
life, and Madam Iceberg in all her furs sitting there
as grim as an image. They went very fast and soon
all the shops were left behind, and the houses, and
they started to climb the hill toward the big gate.</p>

<p>Then something made her look around suddenly
and their eyes met. “Well,” she said, surprised,
“who are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Bunny Face,” he answered promptly.</p>

<p>For a minute she looked as if she might laugh; but
she didn’t. Then she said, “Do you know who I
am?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bunny Face; “they all call you
Madam Iceberg.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” was all she said.</p>

<p>Bunny Face was about to let go when she turned
around again and said, “Now hold on tight.” They
were turning in through the big iron gates which
stood open.</p>

<p>Then the sleigh stopped in front of the house,
and Madam Iceberg handed Bunny Face one of her
bundles to carry, saying, “Here, boy, take this.”
The driver looked surprised, and so did the maid
who opened the door; but nobody said a word—just
followed her inside.</p>

<p>It was big and dark and quiet in the house. Then
suddenly Bunny Face saw something that made
him stop short and drop the bundle.</p>

<p>“<i>There’s</i> the Spirit of Christmas,” he shouted as
loud as he could shout.</p>

<p>“Where—what?” asked the lady, ever so surprised.</p>

<p>“There on the wall,” cried Bunny Face, running
quickly past the amazed group and stopping in front
of the portrait of a beautiful person in white with
flowers in her hair.</p>

<p>“You silly boy!” said Madam Iceberg. “That’s
only my portrait—when I was married.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not you,” said Bunny Face, giving her a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
long look and shaking his head. “It’s the Spirit of
Christmas. I’ve found her, I’ve found her!” he
cried, jumping about and clapping his hands.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about at all,
Mr. Bunny Face, but come over here and sit down,
and we’ll hear all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s lots about it,” said Bunny Face;
“and you’re in it, too, for you aren’t going to have
any Christmas—you, and the school janitor, and the
dump children, and Agnes, and me—none of us are
going to get presents.”</p>

<p>Then Bunny Face told her about Agnes, and the
Parson, and the dump children who didn’t believe in
Santa Claus or anything. “That’s about all,” he
said, “except Santa Claus’ house, and I couldn’t
find that.”</p>

<p>So Bunny Face stood up and said he must go, and
when he looked back Madam Iceberg had sunk down
deep in her chair, so that he could hardly see
her. But the Spirit of Christmas on the wall looked
like a white angel.</p>

<p>Something exciting and most surprising happened
the next day. The school janitor, Old Crab, was in
jail. Yes, sir; and the big boys were down there trying
to see him through the bars. He had been caught
in Madam Iceberg’s house the night before, stealing.
The servants found him as he was getting away
with a big roast under his arm.</p>

<p>Everybody was wondering what she would do
about it. Would she have him let off maybe, because
it was so near Christmas? But nobody really expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
her to do that. And just then the Parson
came walking along with his sister, and this one and
that one told him that he was the very person to go
up and talk to the madam about letting the janitor
go. It was his duty. But he shook his head and said
that “it wouldn’t do a bit of good, not a bit!” But
his sister said, “Oh, Archibald, do!” So he went,
the poor man.</p>

<p>When he rang the bell he told himself that he was
a fool for coming; but the door opened just then, so
he couldn’t run; and the maid was saying, “Come
in, please.” And after a while Madam Iceberg came
walking in.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve come to talk about little Bunny Face,
I know,” she said, smiling and holding out her hand.
“He has the most fantastic ideas,” she said, “and
he calls my portrait in the hall the Spirit of Christmas,
though I can’t see why.”</p>

<p>You can guess how surprised the Parson was; but
he asked to see the picture, and said he quite agreed
with Bunny Face. And Madam Iceberg looked
pleased. Then they talked on and on, but not a word
was said about the janitor until the Parson was
about to leave. Then he told her. But he didn’t seem
at all astonished when she said to let him go—by
all means. Yes, certainly, considering the season
and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the Reverend Mr. Brisbane
was seen walking out through the big gates quite
smartly and smiling most pleasantly.</p>

<p>Then one day Madam Iceberg’s big green sleigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
stopped right in front of Katie Duckworth’s store,
which was the first time that that had ever happened.
And she got out herself and walked in. All
the customers in the store turned around and stared.</p>

<p>“Ah, here you are, Mr. Bunny Face. I’ve been
looking for you everywhere. I want you to help me—that
is, I want you to join me in some secrets and
surprises.”</p>

<p>Just then Katie Duckworth came over to see what
was wanted, and Madam Iceberg explained very
politely that she would like to borrow her nephew
for a little while to help with some Christmas
plans.</p>

<p>Katie Duckworth said, “All right, ma’am.”</p>

<p>So Bunny Face got his cap and muffler and followed
Madam Iceberg out to the big green sleigh.
Then she told the driver to drive around a bit, because
she and the young man must have a talk.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Bunny Face, please begin and name
over that list of folks who won’t have any Christmas
this year,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bunny Face, “there’s me, of course,
and Agnes, then the dump children, and the janitor
and—and you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Madam Iceberg; “and I want
you to help me make plans. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” chirped Bunny Face. “Toys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, toys,” she said. “But where do we
get them?”</p>

<p>“Why, old Mrs. Hampton’s Toy Shop, of course,”
said Bunny Face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>So the lady bent forward and said, “Mrs. Hampton’s
Toy Shop, driver.”</p>

<p>When old Mrs. Hampton saw them and knew who
it was, she took off her thick glasses, then put them
back on again quickly. But she didn’t say “Run
along,” today, but “What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>And before Madam Iceberg could answer Mrs.
Hampton, Bunny Face grabbed her skirt and, pulling
her along, pointed to a picture of Santa Claus
coming out of a funny little house under some tall
pine trees.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” he said; “Santa Claus’ house.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said Madam Iceberg; “Sure enough;
that’s the house that you were hunting, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>But Bunny Face didn’t answer. He had his head
on one side and was staring with all his eyes.</p>

<p>The lady puckered her lips and pointed and sort
of blinked; so old Mrs. Hampton wrote in her order
book: “1 framed picture, entitled The House of
Santa Claus.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Madam Iceberg in a business-like
tone, “let’s begin to buy toys.”</p>

<p>“Who for?” asked Bunny Face.</p>

<p>“For your dump children,” answered Madam Iceberg.</p>

<p>So Bunny Face began. “That and that and that,”
he said, pointing at fire engines and kites and hobbyhorses.
And they bought dolls and dishes and sewing
baskets for girls.</p>

<p>Then Madam Iceberg paid for the things out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
her purse, and told Mrs. Hampton to send them up
to her house, and said “Good-day.”</p>

<p>The other customers looked too surprised to speak
when the lady and the little boy closed the door behind
them.</p>

<p>When they were back in the sleigh and all covered
up, she said, “Now how about Agnes’ present?”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t any place to sleep,” said Bunny Face,
“but under the stove.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Madam Iceberg; “then probably
a basket with a red cushion in it would please her;
don’t you think it might?”</p>

<p>Yes, Bunny Face thought that it might.</p>

<p>So the lady said that she would make the red
cushion herself; then she told the driver to go to
the hardware store, and they went in and she bought
several baskets.</p>

<p>“But,” said Bunny Face, “Agnes only needs
one.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of the janitor and some others on
your list,” said Madam Iceberg.</p>

<p>“Are we going to give him a present?” asked
Bunny Face.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Madam Iceberg, “for he’s on
your list.” So at the next store she bought good
things to fill baskets. Bunny Face thought she’d
never stop.</p>

<p>“And now,” she said, “we’re finished.”</p>

<p>“There are two more names yet,” said Bunny
Face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“What?” said Madam Iceberg, with the twinkle
look. “Two more?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Bunny Face. “Yours and mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is so,” she said; “but I’ll have to talk
to Santa Claus about your present, so that you’ll
be surprised. That’s one of my secrets, you know.”</p>

<p>Of course that sounded pretty pleasant to Bunny
Face—talking to Santa Claus about secrets and
surprises. But something worried him at the same
time: What was Madam Iceberg to get? And he
grew so quiet that finally she bent over and looked
at him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are going to get for
Christmas,” said Bunny Face slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, I know what I want,” said the lady gayly.</p>

<p>“Oh, what?” asked Bunny Face, sitting up
straight.</p>

<p>“Why, a little guest on Christmas day,” she answered.</p>

<p>“A little what?” asked Bunny Face, for that
wasn’t a present at all.</p>

<p>“Yes, a little guest, one Mr. Bunny Face, to come
early on Christmas morning and stay all day. And
to go around with me and help with all the secrets
and surprises.”</p>

<p>When Bunny Face got out of the sleigh in front
of Katie Duckworth’s store he not only felt that he
had found Santa Claus’ house on Clark’s road, but
that he had been talking with the Spirit of Christmas
as well. But it was true, all of it, and the driver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
was to come for him early on Christmas morning;
and Agnes could go too.</p>

<p>Now, Bunny Face had never had a secret before
in his whole life, and he found that keeping one
was not as easy as he had expected. But he did enjoy
sing-songing to the rest of us children “I have
a secret I won’t tell,” as we all walked to school.
But nobody really believed it, for who could have
a secret with Katie Duckworth?</p>

<p>As you might know, Bunny Face was up pretty
early on Christmas morning, all ready, holding
Agnes and watching out the front window. You
could hear sleigh bells everywhere and people’s
voices calling, “Same to you,” and “Merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>Then came a sleigh, around the corner, and
stopped in front of Katie Duckworth’s store. The
driver jumped out and ran in with a basket with
red ribbons flying and a letter tied to the handle.
The letter said “A happy Christmas to Miss Duckworth,”
and please to allow her nephew to come
and spend the day.</p>

<p>Katie untied the ribbons and looked inside, and
there were oranges and nuts that they could see;
and so she said “All right” to Bunny Face, who
picked up Agnes and said good-by. As they went
through the gate, Bunny Face saw wreaths in all the
windows and over the big door, and Madam Iceberg
was standing there, waving her hand.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!” she said.</p>

<p>And then it really began. First there were all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
wreaths, and pine branches over the fireplace, and
candles, and right under the Spirit of Christmas
there was a trimmed Christmas tree. My, my, such
a tree! You never saw the like. But under the tree—toys,
toys! toys! Beginning with a velocipede—there
was a sled, games, books, skates, a dark lantern. Oh,
goodness me! I can’t tell you all the things that there
were. And if you’ll believe it, there was the picture
of Santa Claus’ house—the very one!</p>

<p>For a minute Bunny Face just couldn’t talk; then
he jumped up and down and ran back and forth, pulling
Madam Iceberg around by the hand, showing her
this one and that one, and how it worked. My, how
they laughed at everything. “For Miss Agnes from
Bunny Face and Madam Iceberg” was what it
said on the letter tied to one Christmas present. And
beside the basket and the red cushion was a ball for
her to play with. Bunny Face put her in and held her
down with both hands till she went to sleep.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Bunny Face,” said the lady, “we
must go and take care of those other surprises.”</p>

<p>“To the dump?” asked Bunny Face.</p>

<p>“Yes, and on the way back we’ll stop at your
Parson’s,” said Madam Iceberg.</p>

<p>Well, right then the sleigh came jingling around
the house and stopped at the door, and what do you
suppose? Well, all those toys from Mrs. Hampton’s
Toy Shop were packed in that sleigh, which made it
look exactly like Santa Claus’. It was a strange
sight, that sleigh full of toys stopping in front of
the janitor’s shanty. The dump children heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
bells and came tumbling out pellmell to see what
there was to see.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, everybody!” said Madam Iceberg,
beginning to hand them toys. Then came the
big basket with the Christmas dinner for the
janitor and all the children.</p>

<p>“Next to the Parson’s; then home again, Mr.
Bunny Face, and you will please hand him this?”
said Madam Iceberg as she put a letter into his
pocket.</p>

<p>But the Parson and his sister heard the sleigh
bells coming, and the door was open before they got
there, and everyone was saying “Merry Christmas!”
and “The same to you!” as fast and loud as
he could.</p>

<p>Then Bunny Face said to the Parson, taking out
the letter, “I am to hand you this.”</p>

<p>And the Parson took it and read, “With every
good wish from your friends, Bunny Face and
Madam Iceberg.” And he seemed greatly pleased,
and said: “Well, I guess we all know something
about the Spirit of Christmas now.”</p>

<p>“It’s her, it’s her,” shouted Bunny Face, pointing
at Madam Iceberg, and he flew over and shook
her by the coat, saying, “Now I know what those
words mean.”</p>

<p>And she looked very happy as they started toward
home.</p>

<p>“Fe, fi, fo, fum! I smell a turkey,” said the lady
as the door was opened, and they went into the hall.
“Let’s be quick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>So taking off their things—and a-hold of hands—they
went out where a table was set with two chairs,
one for Bunny Face and one for her. And in the
center there were red candles burning, and a Santa
Claus with a pack on his back. Then they sat down
and Madam Iceberg leaned over and said, “Merry
Christmas, <i>Sunny</i> Face—for that is what I am going
to call you.”</p>

<p>And he said, “Same to you!” and a big smile
started and ran clear across his face and both ears
wiggled pleasantly.</p>

<p>Then the dinner began to come in. First a turkey
on a big platter, all trimmed up and so brown and
shiny that it looked varnished. Next were all sorts
of dishes of different things with covers over them
to keep them hot, and you couldn’t begin to guess
what was in them all. “A little more gravy over
everything” or “Do have another drumstick,”
Madam Iceberg would say.</p>

<p>Then finally they both leaned back in their chairs
and didn’t eat any more. They talked about all sorts
of things and asked each other questions, back and
forth—and he asked her if she knew any stories!</p>

<p>She said: “You’re right I do, Mr. Sunny Face.
Come, let’s go in by the fire and tell them there.”</p>

<p>So they took hold of hands and went.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eastward</span> from the Sierras rises a strong red hill
known as Pine Mountain, though the Indians call it
The Hill of Summer Snow. At its foot stands a town
of a hundred board houses, given over wholly to the
business of mining. The noise of it goes on by day
and night,—the creak of the windlasses, the growl
of the stamps in the mill, the clank of the cars running
down to the dump, and from the open doors of
the drinking saloons, great gusts of laughter and
the sound of singing. Billows of smoke roll up from
the tall stacks and by night are lit ruddily by the
smelter fires all going at a roaring blast.</p>

<p>Whenever the charcoal-burner’s son looked down
on the red smoke, the glare, and the hot breath of
the furnaces, it seemed to him like an exhalation
from the wickedness that went on continually in the
town; though all he knew of wickedness was the
word, a rumor from passers-by, and a kind of childish
fear. The charcoal-burner’s cabin stood on a
spur of Pine Mountain two thousand feet above the
town, and sometimes the boy went down to it on the
back of the laden burros when his father carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
charcoal to the furnaces. All else that he knew were
the wild creatures of the mountain, the trees, the
storms, the small flowering things, and away at the
back of his heart a pale memory of his mother like
the faint forest odor that clung to the black embers
of the pine. They had lived in the town when the
mother was alive and the father worked in the
mines. There were not many women or children in
the town at that time, but mining men jostling with
rude quick ways; and the young mother was not
happy.</p>

<p>“Never let my boy grow up in such a place,” she
said as she lay dying; and when they had buried her
in the coarse shallow soil, her husband looked for
comfort up toward The Hill of Summer Snow shining
purely, clear white and quiet in the sun. It swam
in the upper air above the sooty rock of the town and
seemed as if it called. Then he took the young child
up to the mountain, built a cabin under the tamarack
pines, and a pit for burning charcoal for the furnace
fires.</p>

<p>No one could wish for a better place for a boy to
grow up in than the slope of Pine Mountain. There
was the drip of pine balm and a wind like wine,
white water in the springs, and as much room for
roaming as one desired. The charcoal-burner’s son
chose to go far, coming back with sheaves of strange
bloom from the edge of snow banks on the high
ridges, bright spar or peacock-painted ores, hatfuls
of berries, or strings of shining trout. He played
away whole mornings in glacier meadows where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
heard the eagle scream; walking sometimes in a
mist of cloud he came upon deer feeding, or waked
them from their lair in the deep fern. On snow-shoes
in winter he went over the deep drifts and spied
among the pine tops on the sparrows, the grouse,
and the chilly robins wintering under the green
tents. The deep snow lifted him up and held him
among the second stories of the trees. But that was
not until he was a great lad, straight and springy
as a young fir. As a little fellow he spent his days
at the end of a long rope staked to a pine just out of
reach of the choppers and the charcoal-pits. When
he was able to go about alone, his father made him
give three promises: never to follow a bear’s trail
nor meddle with the cubs, never to try to climb the
eagle rocks after the young eagles, never to lie
down nor to sleep on the sunny, south slope where
the rattlesnakes frequented. After that he was free
of the whole wood.</p>

<p>When Mathew, for so the boy was called, was ten
years old, he began to be of use about the charcoal
pits, to mark the trees for cutting, to sack the coals,
to keep the house, and cook his father’s meals. He
had no companions of his own age nor wanted any,
for at this time he loved the silver firs. A group of
them grew in a swale below the cabin, tall and fine;
the earth under them was slippery and brown with
needles. Where they stood close together with over-lapping
boughs the light among the tops was golden
green, but between the naked boles it was a vapor
thin and blue. These were the old trees that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
wagged their tops together for three hundred years.
Around them stood a ring of saplings and seedlings
scattered there by the parent firs, and a little apart
from these was the one that Mathew loved. It was
slender of trunk and silvery white, the branches
spread out fanwise to the outline of a perfect spire.
In the spring, when the young growth covered it as
with a gossamer web, it gave out a pleasant odor,
and it was to him like the memory of what his
mother had been. Then he garlanded it with flowers
and hung streamers of white clematis all heavy with
bloom upon its boughs. He brought it berries in cups
of bark and sweet water from the spring; always as
long as he knew it, it seemed to him that the fir
tree had a soul.</p>

<p>The first trip he had ever made on snow-shoes
was to see how it fared among the drifts. That was
always a great day when he could find the slender
cross of its topmost bough above the snow. The fir
was not very tall in those days, but the snows as
far down on the slope as the charcoal-burner’s cabin
lay shallowly. There was a time when Mathew expected
to be as tall as the fir, but after a while the
boy did not grow so fast and the fir kept on adding
its whorl of young branches every year.</p>

<p>Mathew told it all his thoughts. When at times
there was a heaviness in his breast which was really
a longing for his mother, though he did not understand
it, he would part the low spreading branches
and creep up to the slender trunk of the fir. Then
he would put his arms around it and be quiet for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
long beautiful time. The tree had its own way of
comforting him; the branches swept the ground and
shut him in dark and close. He made a little cairn of
stones under it and kept his treasures there.</p>

<p>Often as he lay snuggled up to the heart of the
tree, the boy would slip his hand over the smooth
intervals between the whorls of boughs, and wonder
how they knew the way to grow. All the fir trees are
alike in this, that they throw out their branches from
the main stem like the rays of a star, one added to
another with the season’s growth. They stand out
stiffly from the trunk, and the shape of each new
bough in the beginning and the shape of the last
growing twig when they have spread out broadly
with many branchlets, bending with the weight of
their own needles, is the shape of a cross; and the
topmost sprig that rises above all the star-built
whorls is a long and slender cross, until by the
springing of new branches it becomes a star. So the
two forms go on running into and repeating each
other, and each star is like all the stars, and every
bough is another’s twin. It is this trim and certain
growth that sets out the fir from all the mountain
trees, and gives to the young saplings a secret look
as they stand straight and stiffly among the wild
brambles on the hill. For the wood delights to grow
abroad at all points, and one might search a summer
long without finding two leaves of the oak alike, or
any two trumpets of the spangled mimulus. So, as at
that time he had nothing better worth studying
about, Mathew noticed and pondered the secret of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the silver fir, and grew up with it until he was twelve
years old and tall and strong for his age. By this
time the charcoal-burner began to be troubled about
the boy’s schooling.</p>

<p>Meantime there was rioting and noise and coming
and going of strangers in the town at the foot of
Pine Mountain, and the furnace blast went on ruddily
and smokily. Because of the things he heard
Mathew was afraid, and on rare occasions when he
went down to it he sat quietly among the charcoal
sacks, and would not go far away from them except
when he held his father by the hand. After a time it
seemed life went more quietly there, flowers began
to grow in the yards of the houses, and they met
children walking in the streets with books upon
their arms.</p>

<p>“Where are they going, father?” said the boy.</p>

<p>“To school,” said the charcoal-burner.</p>

<p>“And may I go?” asked Mathew.</p>

<p>“Not yet, my son.”</p>

<p>But one day his father pointed out the foundations
of a new building going up in the town.</p>

<p>“It is a church,” he said, “and when that is finished
it will be a sign that there will be women here
like your mother, and then you may go to school.”</p>

<p>Mathew ran and told the fir tree all about it.</p>

<p>“But I will never forget you, never,” he cried,
and he kissed the trunk. Day by day, from the spur
of the mountain, he watched the church building, and
it was wonderful how much he could see in that
clear, thin atmosphere; no other building in town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
interested him so much. He saw the walls go up and
the roof, and the spire rise skyward with something
that glittered twinkling on its top. Then they painted
the church white and hung a bell in the tower.
Mathew fancied he could hear it of Sundays as he
saw the people moving along like specks in the
streets.</p>

<p>“Next week,” said the father, “the school begins,
and it is time for you to go as I promised. I will
come to see you once a month, and when the term is
over you shall come back to the mountain.” Mathew
said goodby to the fir tree, and there were tears in
his eyes though he was happy. “I shall think of you
very often,” he said, “and wonder how you are
getting along. When I come back I will tell you
everything that happens. I will go to church, and I
am sure I shall like that. It has a cross on top like
yours, only it is yellow and shines. Perhaps when I
am gone I shall learn why you carry a cross, also.”
Then he went a little timidly, holding fast by his
father’s hand.</p>

<p>There were so many people in the town that it was
quite as strange and fearful to him as it would be to
you who had grown up in town to be left alone in the
wood. At night, when he saw the charcoal-burner’s
fires glowing up in the air where the bulk of the
mountain melted into the dark, he would cry a little
under the blankets, but after he began to learn,
there was no more occasion for crying. It was to the
child as though there had been a candle lighted in a
dark room. On Sunday he went to the church, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
then it was both light and music, for he heard the
minister read about God in the great book and believed
it all, for everything that happens in the
woods is true, and people who grow up in it are best
at believing. Mathew thought it was all as the minister
said, that there is nothing better than pleasing
God. Then when he lay awake at night he would try
to think how it would have been with him if he had
never come to this place. In his heart he began to be
afraid of the time when he would have to go back to
the mountain, where there was no one to tell him
about this most important thing in the world, for his
father never talked to him of these things. It preyed
upon his mind, but if any one noticed it, they thought
that he pined for his father and wished himself at
home.</p>

<p>It drew toward midwinter, and the white cap of
The Hill of Summer Snow, which never quite melted
even in the warmest weather, began to spread downward
until it reached the charcoal-burner’s home.
There was a great stir and excitement among the
children, for it had been decided to have a Christmas
tree in the church. Every Sunday now the
Christ-child story was told over and grew near and
brighter like the Christmas star. Mathew had not
known about it before, except that on a certain day
in the year his father had bought him toys. He had
supposed that it was because it was stormy and he
had to be indoors. Now he was wrapped up in the
story of love and sacrifice, and felt his heart grow
larger as he breathed it in, looking upon clear windless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
nights to see if he might discern the Star of
Bethlehem rising over Pine Mountain and the
Christ-child come walking on the snow. It was not
that he really expected it, but that the story was so
alive in him. It is easy for those who had lived long
in the high mountains to believe in beautiful things.
Mathew wished in his heart that he might never go
away from this place. He sat in his seat in church,
and all that the minister said sank deeply into his
mind.</p>

<p>When it came time to decide about the tree, because
Mathew’s father was a charcoal-burner and
knew where the best trees grew, it was quite natural
to ask him to furnish the tree for his part. Mathew
fairly glowed with delight, and his father was
pleased, too, for he liked to have his son noticed. The
Saturday before Christmas, which fell on Tuesday
that year, was the time set for going for the tree,
and by that time Mathew had quite settled in his
mind that it should be his silver fir. He did not know
how otherwise he could bring the tree to share in
his new delight, nor what else he had worth giving,
for he quite believed what he had been told, that it is
only through giving the best beloved that one comes
to the heart’s desire. With all his heart Mathew
wished never to live in any place where he might not
hear about God. So when his father was ready with
the ropes and the sharpened axe, the boy led the way
to the silver firs.</p>

<p>“Why, that is a little beauty,” said the charcoal-burner,
“and just the right size.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>They were obliged to shovel away the snow to get
at it for cutting, and Mathew turned away his face
when the chips began to fly. The tree fell upon its
side with a shuddering sigh; little beads of clear
resin stood out about the scar of the axe. It seemed
as if the tree wept. But how graceful and trim it
looked when it stood in the church waiting for gifts!
Mathew hoped that it would understand.</p>

<p>The charcoal-burner came to church on Christmas
eve, the first time in many years. It makes a difference
about these things when you have a son to take
part in them. The church and the tree were alight
with candles; to the boy it seemed like what he supposed
the place of dreams might be. One large
candle burned on the top of the tree and threw out
pointed rays like a star; it made the charcoal-burner’s
son think of Bethlehem. Then he heard the
minister talking, and it was all of a cross and a star;
but Mathew could only look at the tree, for he saw
that it trembled, and he felt that he had betrayed it.
Then the choir began to sing, and the candle on the
top of the tree burned down quite low, and Mathew
saw the slender cross of the topmost bough stand
up dark before it. Suddenly he remembered his old
puzzle about it, how the smallest twigs were divided
off in each in the shape of a cross, how the boughs
repeated the star form every year, and what was
true of his fir was true of them all. Then it must have
been that there were tears in his eyes, for he could
not see plainly: the pillars of the church spread upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
like the shafts of the trees, and the organ
playing was like the sound of the wind in their
branches, and the stately star-built firs rose up like
spires, taller than the church tower, each with a
cross on top. The sapling which was still before him
trembled more, moving its boughs as if it spoke;
and the boy heard it in his heart and believed, for it
spoke to him of God. Then all the fear went out of
his heart and he had no more dread of going back
to the mountain to spend his days, for now he knew
that he need never be away from the green reminder
of hope and sacrifice in the star and the cross of the
silver fir; and the thought broadened in his mind
that he might find more in the forest than he had
ever thought to find, now that he knew what to look
for, since everything speaks of God in its own way
and it is only a matter of understanding how.</p>

<p>It was very gay in the little church that Christmas
night, with laughter and bonbons flying about, and
every child had a package of candy and an armful
of gifts. The charcoal-burner had his pockets bulging
full of toys, and Mathew’s eyes glowed like the
banked fires of the charcoal-pits as they walked
home in the keen, windless night.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” said the charcoal-burner, “I am
afraid you will not be wanting to go back to the
mountain with me after this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I will,” said Mathew happily, “for I
think the mountains know quite as much of the important
things as they know here in the town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Right you are,” said the charcoal-burner, as he
clapped his boy’s hand between both his own, “and
I am pleased to think you have turned out such a
sensible little fellow.” But he really did not know
all that was in his son’s heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Oh,</span> Eb, it runs! It really does!”</p>

<p>Nell, who was twelve—a slender, sunny-haired
little creature—first clasped her hands, then clapped
them, then danced up and down the old woodshed
pausing at last in front of a big kitchen table, where
a toy engine and train of cars were making a circuit
around and around and around a tiny track. The
hired boy, Eb—a few years older, rough-handed
and poorly dressed—smiled at the child’s pleasure.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” he said. “I didn’t have to do
much to it.”</p>

<p>“But you did, Eb. It was all broken to pieces.
Papa would be awfully disappointed to find it that
way when he comes, and Tommy would never have
gotten over it. Never! He’s set his heart on a train
for Christmas, and it’s been promised to him, and
now to have it all smashed in the express! Oh, Eb,
nobody could have fixed it but you. You’re a real
genius, mamma says, and ought to go to a mechanical
school. Isn’t it lucky you’re living with Uncle
Bob when we come to visit him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>The dainty, dancing fairy stopped suddenly and
held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>“Sh, Eb! There’s Tommy now! He’s coming
back! Oh, stop it! stop it! and cover it so he can’t
see! He’ll be coming straight in here, I know!”</p>

<p>Outside there were the wild whoop of a small boy
with large lungs, a clatter of a sled, a stamping of
feet, then a plunging into the kitchen, just as Eb
had slipped a stick through the train wheels to stop
it, and covered it with an old homespun saddle
blanket, gathered hastily from the corner. A moment
later Tommy burst in, red, snowy, and full of the
curiosity which most healthy boys are likely to have,
especially about Christmas-time.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Nell, you and Eb?
What have you been making with all that wire, and
those tools? What’s that blanket on the table? Pooh,
Bess! What are you shivering for with that great
cape on? I’m not cold, and I’ve been coasting for
over an hour, down the back-barn hill! Oh, say, come
in the kitchen, Nell! I want to show you a funny
icicle I found. Come quick, before it’s all melted
away!”</p>

<p>Like a whirlwind he had stormed in and out, followed
closely by Nell, who threw a merry glance of
relief over her shoulder. Eb, leaning against the
work-bench, smiled back; then, with a sigh, saw them
disappear.</p>

<p>For Nellie’s words and her mother’s had set his
heart to beating with something like hope. What if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
there really could be a way by which he could go to
such a place as she had mentioned, and learn to be
a—a— And then, as he saw them go out, and the
door close behind them, it seemed as if hope went out
with them. They would all be gone in a few days and
never remember him again. He hurried off to pitch
down the evening hay for the cattle, and see if he
couldn’t forget, too.</p>

<p>From earliest childhood Eben Lessing had worked
with tools—a one-bladed knife at first, then such
other clumsy things as he could get hold of. With
these he had made curious toys that would run by
water, or wind, or heat, or steam, some of them quite
useful. When he came to Robert Whittaker’s to live
he built, besides other things, a churn of a new
pattern, and a fan over the dining-room table, both
to run by water-power brought from the brook. And
when Mrs. William Whittaker, who was from the
city, had seen these things, she had said the boy deserved
a mechanical education, and then forgot all
about it again, being very busy with all the Christmas
preparations, while Eb, pitching down great
wads of sweet hay from the barn loft, was still
dreaming in spite of himself, of a day when he
should leave the district school for a mechanical
college, and become a great inventor, and marry
Nellie Whittaker, and so live happy ever after. Then
it came milking-time, and swishing the broad white
streams into the foaming pail, he dreamed again,
and kept on dreaming even after he was in bed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
asleep. Then he forgot, and when he remembered
again it was morning—the morning of the day before
Christmas.</p>

<p>What a busy day that was! Of course, quite early,
Eb had to drive in for papa, who was coming on the
first train, and Nellie and Tom had to go along in
the surrey. Then, when papa came, there was so
much to tell, only, of course, Nell couldn’t tell how
Tommy’s train had been broken and fixed, because
Tommy wasn’t to know anything about the train
until he saw it travelling around and around on
the little track that was to go clear around under the
Christmas tree. Then, at home, there were all the
places to see—all the places that papa had seen
as a little boy: the hill where he used to slide, the
same back-barn hill where Tommy had been coasting,
the brook where he used to fish, the hay-mow, and the
horses and cows, and the hens’ nests where Nell and
Tommy had found eggs, and where Tommy had been
whipped by an old hen that wanted to sit; though
why she should want to sit there all day in the cold on
two nubbins of corn and a lump of frozen dirt that
somebody had thrown at her, Tommy said he, for
one, couldn’t see.</p>

<p>Papa laughed, and said that maybe if she sat there
until spring on the nubbins and frozen dirt she’d
hatch out a corn-field. Then they went into the
kitchen, where mamma and Aunt Maria—a big
motherly woman who had never had any children
of her own, except one little boy named Willie, and
that died—were baking and stirring, and opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and closing oven doors, so that people had better
keep out of the way. Only you couldn’t, because it
smelt so nice in there of mince-meat, and of baking-cakes
that came out all brown, with buttered paper
sticking to them when they were turned out of the
pans. Then, all at once, they found that Aunt Maria
had turned out a little brown cake, from a little pan,
and she cut it hot, and Tommy had a piece, and Nellie
and papa, just as he used to have the day before
Christmas, when he was a little boy. And after this
they went into the dining-room and saw Eb’s patent
fan, and into the pantry to look at Eb’s churn, and
papa said, “Well, well!” and that somebody ought
to give a boy like that a chance.</p>

<p>But they forgot all about it when they got to the
parlor and looked at the funny album that had
pictures of papa and Uncle Bob, taken together,
when papa was a very little boy and Uncle Bob was
his big brother. And when Uncle Bob came in they
talked about the day they had it taken, more than
thirty years ago, and how papa had rolled up his
eyes and didn’t keep still, and all that happened
afterwards—the things that people always talk
about when they forget for a little while that they
are grown up, and only remember that they were
once boys and girls, like the rest of us.</p>

<p>And in the afternoon they had to go and cut and
bring in the Christmas tree. Tom and Mollie had
already picked out a bushy little spruce up on the
mountain-side, and Eb went along, because Eb had
been with them and knew the way. Besides, Eb could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
cut better with a hatchet than anybody, so Tommy
said.</p>

<p>Then Tommy walked down the hill with his papa,
talking all the time, while Eb and Nellie, side by
side, dragged the little spruce over the snow, and
Nellie talked and Eb listened, and was never so
happy before in all his life, and never so sad, either,
because next week it would all be over, and he would
be there alone, with no school except the district
school, where he had learned about all he could, and
with no chance of becoming a great inventor, and
doing all the things that he had dreamed.</p>

<p>Of course Eb had to help to trim the tree. He had
never trimmed one before, but he was the handiest
of them all, and could go up a step-ladder and fasten
tapers to the high limbs, and string popcorn and
tinsel just in the very places where it ought to be.
Then, when that part of it was all done, and it was
getting towards evening—that wonderful evening
of hush and mystery and joy—Christmas eve—it
was Nellie who said that Eb must be Santa Claus,
and put the presents on the tree.</p>

<p>“If we put them on, ourselves, then everybody
will see just what they are to have, and who gives
it,” she said. “If Eb puts them on, nobody will
know until Christmas morning. We’ll darken the
sitting-room, and each one can go in and put down
his things, and come right out again. Then, after
supper, Eb can go in and unwrap them, and put them
on the tree. Of course, Tommy, the real Santa Claus,
will come afterwards, and put on his things, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>Nellie did not mention that she had a bright new
tie for Eb. She knew there would be a chance to put
that on, herself, in the morning.</p>

<p>Everybody said Nellie’s plan was a good one; so
by-and-by Eb found himself in the sitting-room alone,
with a great many whispered instructions, and the
beautiful tree, and packages and packages of things
to be unwrapped and arranged in and about it.
Tommy and Nell were tiptoeing and whispering
about the hall, and Nellie called to Eb to lock the
door or Tommy would just <i>have</i> to come inside. So
Eb locked it, laughing, and wished in his soul that
Nellie at least might come in to help him. Then he
noticed that somebody had put a lot of loose cotton
around the foot of the tree to represent snow, and
he looked from this to the little candles on the
slender limbs, and shook his head, and said something
about fire and tow being pretty close together.
By-and-by he went out to the kitchen to wash his
hands. When he came in he stopped a moment to arrange
something in the corner, before going on with
his work. The house was quite still now, but it was
after midnight before Eb was ready to go to his
bed.</p>

<p>It had been a wonderful evening for him. He had
unwrapped and seen at close range all the pretty
things that well-to-do people give one another at
Christmas-time; books, games, pictures, ornaments,
articles of dress, confections, and even gems. He had
arranged and rearranged, and with a natural eye
for the beautiful had placed the things as showily as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
most people could have done, and with great thought
of their safety. When he was through at last he
stood back to admire his work. Then all at once he
remembered that Tommy’s train was still hidden
in the wood-shed. He had forgotten it entirely.</p>

<p>He brought in the engine and cars, and then the
track, in sections, and soon had it all arranged under
the tree, so that it would travel around and
around, though he had to move some books and other
things to do it. Then he tried the train a little, to see
that it would run as well as ever. He hated to leave
it all; but he blew out the lamp at last and went to
bed, wondering if by any chance he would oversleep
next morning, and so fail to light up, and have everything
in order when Tom and Nellie and the others
were ready to come down.</p>

<p>“Whoop! Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>Eb sat straight up in bed. He had overslept, then,
after all. No; for it was still dark. He did not believe
it could be five o’clock.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Eb! Say, get up and light the
tree! I want to see my things.”</p>

<p>It was Tommy, of course, and the whole house
would be roused and ready to come down presently.
Eb leaped into his clothes, made a hasty toilet, and
slipped down the back stairs, leaving Tommy still
shouting Merry Christmas through the halls to
arouse older people from their slumbers.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes everybody had concluded
that it was no use to hold out against Tommy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
in five minutes more everybody had dragged on
something that resembled clothes and a pleasant
smile, and came straggling down the stairs, calling
greetings to one another. Tommy, at the head, was
already pounding at the sitting-room door, while Eb,
inside, was lighting the last tapers, and putting on a
few finishing-touches, such as starting and setting a
new clock for Aunt Maria, and winding up Tommy’s
train. Then, when he heard them all outside, he unlocked
the door, and, stepping back, pulled it wide,
so that all might get a sudden and full view of the
beautiful Christmas tree.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood quite still, blinking from
the brightness of it. Then there came a chorus of
“Oh! oh!” “Well! well!” and, “How beautiful!”
with another wild whoop from Tommy, ending up
with, “Oh, gee! see my train!”</p>

<p>A second later he had bounded forward toward
the precious train, and was ducking down under the
tree for a closer view.</p>

<p>“Tommy!” “Oh, Tom!” “Thomas! Look out.
The candles!”</p>

<p>There was a regular chorus of warnings,—but all
too late. A second later a taper that had been fixed
to a branch, struck by Tommy’s head, had fallen, and
the loose cotton about the tree was afire, the blaze
darting up into the branches.</p>

<p>Tommy rolled out from under the tree like an
armadillo. Nellie clasped her hands and shut her
eyes to keep out the terrible sight and began to moan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and wail. Uncle Robert and Aunt Maria both started
somewhere for pails of water, while papa and
mamma began tugging at a piece of carpet to
smother the blaze.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, there was somebody else
at work, and there came a hissing sound, as if water
was being put on the flames, and right among them
stood Eb, with something over his shoulder and
under his arm, and in his hand there was a sort of a
tube that sent a stream of water just where it was
needed, and that put out the burning cotton in just
about the time it has taken me to tell about it. When
Aunt Maria and Uncle Robert came hurrying back
with pails of water, there was no use for them. Papa
and mamma and Nellie and Tom were gathered
about Eb, more interested in what he had under his
arm and over his shoulder than in the Christmas
tree, which was scarcely damaged at all, for the
flames had not reached the presents, and there was
only a little water on Tommy’s train, which hadn’t
even stopped running, being the kind of train,
Tommy said, that didn’t mind a little thing like
lightning and rain.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Eb’s fire-extinguisher!” said Uncle
Robert. “I forgot all about that!”</p>

<p>“But Eb didn’t!” said Tommy. “He put it in here
last night, because he knew there’d be a fire with all
that cotton of yours, sis.”</p>

<p>“He knew you’d knock over a candle, I guess,”
retorted Nell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>Then the wet cotton was taken away, and the
presents rearranged about the tree, and Tommy’s
train wound up again, and everything was as fine
as if nothing had happened, though they didn’t any
of them forget what might have happened if it
hadn’t been for Eb with his fire-extinguisher.</p>

<p>And that was one of the finest Christmases that
ever was! And at dinner-time Eb was there, with his
bright new tie on, and sat right by Nellie, and was
almost like the hero of the day. And after the turkey
was carved, Mr. William Whittaker said, all at once,
to Eben Lessing, as if he’d just happened to think
of it:</p>

<p>“By-the-way, Eb, how would you like to take a
course in a mechanical school? We’ve a good deal of
room in our house, and now and then I need somebody
to help me. You can come home with us and go
to school, if you like.”</p>

<p>And would you believe it, Eb couldn’t say a word!
He was like the others when he had flung open the
door of the sitting-room and blinded them with the
wonderful tree—he just sat there and blinked.</p>

<p>Nellie answered: “Of course, papa, Eb would like
it. Wouldn’t you, Eb?”</p>

<p>And then, somehow, Eb nodded, and somehow said
something that was taken for yes, and then everybody
began talking at once about the things Eb had
made, and what he would do by-and-by, while
Tommy, who, just at that moment, found out what
it all meant, broke out with a great rejoicing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
“Whoop! Eb’s going home with us! Eb’s going
home with us to live!”</p>

<p>And Nellie whispered, “Oh, Eb, didn’t I tell you
it was lucky you were living with Uncle Bob when
we came to visit him?”</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Temple Bailey</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the night before Christmas—and stormy.</p>

<p>“Sqush—sqush,” went the wheels of the carriage
in the mud.</p>

<p>“Whew—ew—ew,” whistled the wind, and it blew
Peter’s hat into the middle of the road.</p>

<p>“Whoa,” said Peter, and climbed down from his
high seat.</p>

<p>The “Princess” poked her head out of the window.
“What’s the matter?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My hat blew off,” Peter told her, “and the wheel
is stuck in the mud, Miss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Peter, Peter,” the Princess chided, “you
must get that wheel out of the mud at once.”</p>

<p>“Which is easier said than done,” Peter grumbled;
“it’s that dark that I can’t see my hand before
me.”</p>

<p>“There’s a light back there among the trees,” the
Princess informed him; “perhaps you could get
some one to help you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and see, Miss, if you ain’t afraid to stay
alone,” and Peter, after some effort, succeeded in
quieting the plunging horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“I am dreadfully afraid,” came shiveringly, “but
I suppose you will have to go.”</p>

<p>Now in the middle of the pine grove was set a
little cottage. Peter knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked a childish voice, and a
little girl poked her head out of the square window.</p>

<p>“Our wheel is stuck in the mud,” Peter answered,
from the dark, “and I want to get a man to help
me.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any man here,” Jenny informed him.
“There is only me and Jinny; and our mother has
gone to nurse a sick neighbor, and she won’t be home
until morning.”</p>

<p>So Peter went back to the carriage and reported
to the Princess.</p>

<p>“I shall freeze out here,” said the Princess. “I
will go up to the house and sit by the fire while you
look for some one to help you with the carriage.”</p>

<p>She climbed out of the carriage, and with Peter
in the lead, she plodded through the woods, and the
wind blew her long coat this way and that, and at
last, wet and panting, she came to the little house.</p>

<p>And once more Peter knocked, and once more
Jenny came to the window. Then she flung the door
wide open, and so tall was the Princess that she had
to stoop to enter it. It was a dingy little room, and
there was a dumpy black stove in the corner, with a
bubbling iron pot that gave forth a most appetizing
odor.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, how nice and warm it is,” said the
Princess, as she held out her hands to the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>In all their lives the little girls had never beheld
such a wonderful person, for the Princess wore a
long red coat and a black velvet hat with a waving
plume, and her muff was big and round and soft,
and she had a scarf of the same soft fur about her
neck. Her hair was pale gold, and she had the bluest
eyes and the reddest lips, and her smile was so sweet
and tender, that Jenny ran right up to her and
cried: “Oh, I am so glad you came!”</p>

<p>Jinny, from her little chair, echoed her sister’s
words. But she did not run, for there was a tiny
crutch beside Jinny’s chair in the square window.</p>

<p>“And I am glad to be here,” said the Princess,
whose quick eyes were taking in the details of the
shabby room. “It’s so nice and warm and cozy.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” said Jenny, happily, “and we are getting
ready for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>On a small round table beside Jinny’s chair was a
tiny cedar bush, and Jinny’s fingers had been busy
with bits of gold and blue and scarlet paper.</p>

<p>“We are going to pop some popcorn,” Jenny explained,
“and string it, and hang it on the tree.”</p>

<p>“Oh, may I help?” the Princess asked. “I haven’t
popped any corn since I was a little girl.”</p>

<p>Jinny clasped her thin little hands. “I think it
would be the loveliest thing in the world,” she said,
“if you would stay.”</p>

<p>“Peter is going to find some one to help with the
carriage, and I will stay until he comes back.”</p>

<p>And when Peter had gone, the Princess slipped off
the long red coat, and underneath it she wore a shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
silken gown and around her neck was a collar of
pearls.</p>

<p>“And now, if you could lend me an apron,” she
said, “we will pop the corn.”</p>

<p>But Jinny and Jenny were gazing at her speechless.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must be a fairy Princess,” gasped little
Jinny at last.</p>

<p>The beautiful lady laughed joyously. “Peter calls
me the Princess,” she said; “he has lived with me
ever since I was a little girl. But really I am just
an every-day young woman, who is going to spend
Christmas with some friends in the next town.”</p>

<p>She dismissed the subject with a wave of her
hand.</p>

<p>“And now to our popcorn,” she said.</p>

<p>Jenny brought a green gingham apron, and the
Princess tied it on, making a big butterfly bow of the
strings in the back, and then she danced over to the
dumpy little stove and peeped into the bubbling
pot.</p>

<p>“Did you ever smell anything so good?” she
asked. “I am as hungry as hungry.”</p>

<p>The little girls laughed joyously. “It’s bean
soup,” Jenny said, “and we are going to have it for
supper with some little dumplings in it. I was afraid
it wasn’t nice enough for you.”</p>

<p>“Nice enough?” the delightful lady demanded. “I
think bean soup and little dumplings are—um—um!”
and she flung out her hands expressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“I thought,” Jinny remarked quaintly, “that
fairy princesses only ate honey and dew.”</p>

<p>“Which shows that I am not a true Princess,”
said the beautiful lady, “for honey and dew would
never satisfy me.”</p>

<p>Jenny got out three little blue bowls and set them
on a table that was spread with a coarse but spotless
cloth. There was a crusty loaf and clover-sweet
butter, and last and best of all there was the bean
soup and the bobbing little dumplings served together
in an old mulberry tureen.</p>

<p>It was perfectly wonderful to see the Princess in
her shining gown at the head of the table, and little
lame Jinny said, “You were just sent to us for
Christmas. Why, it’s just like</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The night before Christmas, when all through the house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The children were nestled all snug in their beds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads—”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>“But our stockings weren’t hung yet, and <i>we</i>
weren’t in bed!” said Jenny.</p>

<p>“It was too early for that,” said the Princess;
“but let’s go on with the rhyme, just for fun. I see
you know it all through, so you mustn’t mind my
changing it a little:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jenny sprang from her chair to see what was the matter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away to the window she flew like a flash,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, what to her wondering eyes should appear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>“Oh, no, I forgot! I mean</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When what to her wondering eyes should appear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But a carriage stuck in the mud, right out here—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a little old driver, so lively and quick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You must have thought Peter was dear old St. Nick!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The children laughed gleefully, and Jenny said:
“We <i>would</i> have thought that, only we aren’t going
to hang up our stockings this Christmas at all.
Jenny and I aren’t going to get any presents, for
mother hasn’t been well, and she couldn’t get any
sewing. But she said we could make our Christmas
merry, and we were to pretend that we had been to
the big stores in the city, and had bought things for
the tree, and dolls and everything.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lovely way,” said the Princess gently,
and she laid her flashing rings over Jinny’s thin
one.</p>

<p>“And we are going to pretend,” Jenny contributed,
“that our chicken is a turkey. But we won’t
have to pretend about the mince pie, for mother has
made a lovely one.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could help you eat the chicken,” said
the Princess wistfully, “and I should like to meet
your mother. I know she is home-y. And I haven’t
any mother, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the little girls, round-eyed with sympathy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
and then the Princess told them that all her
life she had lived in a big, lonely house, and she had
always yearned for a cozy home and for a sister.</p>

<p>After supper they popped the corn, and just as
they finished in came Peter.</p>

<p>“I can’t find any one to help, Miss,” he announced,
“and it’s snowing. I’ll have to unhitch the
horses and go back to town, and get something to
take you over in.”</p>

<p>“No,” the Princess demurred, as she stood in
the middle of the room with a heaped-up dish of
snowy kernels in her hand. “No, Peter, I am going
to stay here all night.”</p>

<p>Peter stared, and the little girls cried, “Oh, will
you?”</p>

<p>And the Princess said, “I really will. And, Peter,
you can bring up the steamer trunk and my bag.”</p>

<p>“Won’t your friends expect you, Miss?” Peter
inquired, as if awaiting orders.</p>

<p>“I will send a note by you,” was the calm response,
and as the man went out she followed him
and shut the door behind her. “Oh, Peter, Peter,”
she whispered confidentially, “I am going to give
them such a Christmas!”</p>

<p>“The little girls, Miss?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They are so sweet and brave. And I have
the presents in my trunk that I was going to carry
to the other children. But they will have so much
that they won’t miss them, and I shall spend my
Christmas in a plain little house, but it will be a joyful
house, Peter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Miss,” Peter agreed, understandingly.</p>

<p>“I wish we had a big tree!” said the Princess, regretfully.</p>

<p>“Well, leave that to me, Miss,” Peter told her,
eagerly; “you just get them little things to sleep
early, and I’ll be here with a tree.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Peter, Peter Santa Claus!” exclaimed the
Princess, gleefully, “it will be the nicest Christmas
that I have had since I was a wee bit of a girl.”</p>

<p>So Peter went away, and the Princess, with her
eyes shining like stars, danced back into the room
and said, “Oh, let’s play ‘Mariners.’”</p>

<p>Jinny and Jenny had never heard of such a game,
but the Princess told them that she was a ship on
the high seas, and they were to tell from her cargo
what country she hailed from.</p>

<p>“I carry tea,” she began; “where do I hail
from?”</p>

<p>“China,” guessed Jenny.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Japan,” cried Jinny, with her little face glowing.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Then the little girls pondered. “It might be
India,” ventured Jenny, but the Princess shook her
head. Then Jinny cried: “It’s Ceylon!” and that
was right.</p>

<p>And after that Jinny brought a cargo of oranges
from Florida and Jenny brought a cargo of rugs
from Persia, and there were cargoes of spices and of
coal and of coffee and of fish and of grain and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
lumber, and the Princess finished triumphantly by
carrying a cargo of oysters from the Chesapeake
Bay.</p>

<p>“One more,” begged Jinny.</p>

<p>“I carry a cargo of castles,” said the sparkling
Princess; “where do I hail from?”</p>

<p>The little girls guessed and guessed, and at last
the Princess said:</p>

<p>“That wasn’t a fair one, really, for my castles
are castles in Spain.”</p>

<p>Then, with Jinny in her arms, she told them of
her own castle-building, and when she had finished,
she said: “And so your mother shall have all of my
sewing, and that will keep her busy until Spring.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are going to be married, and live happy
ever after,” sighed Jinny, rapturously; “it’s just
what a fairy Princess should do.”</p>

<p>“And what you should do,” said the Princess,
looking at the clock, “is to go to bed, bed, bed, so
that you can wake up early in the morning.”</p>

<p>She tucked them in, and came back later in a
fascinating pink kimono with her hair in a thick yellow
braid, and she kissed them both. But it was little
lame Jinny that she kissed last. And then she went
away, like a glorious vision, and the little girls sank
into slumber.</p>

<p>In the next room the Princess opened the door
cautiously, and there was Peter with snow all over
him, and his arms were full of holly and mistletoe,
and a great tree was propped against the door-post.</p>

<p>“Quietly, quietly, Peter,” warned the Princess.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
And Peter tiptoed in and set the tree up in the
corner, and its top reached to the ceiling.</p>

<p>The Princess opened the steamer trunk and took
out two white Teddy-bears, one with a flaring blue
bow and the other with a flaring pink one, and then
she took out a green and yellow and a red and a blue
fairy book, and a beautiful square basket of candy,
tied with holly ribbon, and then from the very bottom
of the trunk she drew string after string of
shining little silver bells, fastened on red and pale
green ribbons.</p>

<p>“I was going to get up a cotillion figure for the
children at the other house,” the Princess explained
to Peter, “but these little folks need it so much
more.”</p>

<p>The little bells went “tinkle, tinkle,” as Peter
hung them, and Jinny, dreaming in her little bed,
heard the sound and thought it a part of her dream.</p>

<p>And while Peter and the Princess trimmed and
whispered and laughed, some one rattled the doorknob.</p>

<p>Peter opened the door, and there stood a white-faced,
shivering little woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, what has happened to my little girls,” she
panted. “I saw the light and it is so late—” then
as she beheld the golden-haired vision in pink, and
the gay tree, and Peter in his trim livery, she gasped,
“Why, I believe it is fairies—” and she sat down
very suddenly in Jinny’s chair.</p>

<p>“You are the little mother,” said the Princess,
and she knelt beside her, and put her arms around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
her, and told her how she came to be there; and
when she had finished, she said, simply, “and I have
wanted my own mother so much this Christmas,
and the little girls were so sweet, that I knew I
should love you.”</p>

<p>“You poor little thing,” cried the little mother
to the tall Princess; and the beautiful lady put her
head down on the other’s shabby shoulder and wept,
because in spite of her riches she had been very,
very lonely in her big house.</p>

<p>And after Peter had gone, they talked until midnight
of Jinny and Jenny; and then they concocted
great plans about the pretty things that the little
mother was to make for the Princess.</p>

<p>And in the morning, Jinny and Jenny, waking in
the early dawn, saw, sitting on the foot-board of the
bed, two Teddy-bears, one with a flaring pink bow
and one with a flaring blue bow, and the Teddy-bears
held out their arms saucily and gazed at the
happy little girls with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Oo-oh,” cried the little girls, who had never seen
a Teddy-bear before; and that was the beginning of
the most wonderful day of their lives, for all day
the tree went “tinkle, tinkle” as they foraged in its
branches for bon-bons, and the chicken dinner was a
delicious success, and in the afternoon they all took
a ride in the Princess’ sleigh, with Peter driving
on the box, and when at last he set them down on
their own humble door-step, and lifted little Jinny
in his arms, the Princess smiled at them radiantly
from under her plumy hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Remember, Peter will come for you every Saturday,
and you are to stay at my house all day,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Jenny sighed with rapture.</p>

<p>“And you are to come to my wedding in the spring—all
of you!” said the Princess, gaily.</p>

<p>“And see the Prince!” said Jinny, over Peter’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“And you are going to let me share a third of
your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes,” from both of the little girls.</p>

<p>“Then you shall share a third of Peter,” the
Princess called back, as the smiling coachman drove
her away through the glistening snow.</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Ellen Manly</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Jones</span> was standing at his front gate one
bright December morning when a quaint figure came
hurrying along the road—a bent old woman in a
long blue cloak, with the ruffles of a big cap flopping
about her wrinkled face.</p>

<p>“Good day!” said she, as soon as she was near
enough to be heard. “You’re Farmer Jones, I believe.
I think you will do nicely to head the procession—just
step right behind me and we’ll move on!”</p>

<p>“And, pray, who are you and what should I be
doing in a procession?” cried the astonished man.
“I’m quite too busy to leave home to-day!”</p>

<p>“Never mind!” answered the old crone, “I know
all about <i>you</i>, for I’ve heard you grumbling over
the weather many a time. As I came down the hill
just now you were complaining at the cold and wishing
it were June—you’re a regular ‘weather
fretter!’ I’m the Grumble Collector, and you’d better
do just as you’re told or there’ll be trouble. My
name is Dame Quimp, and my work is to hunt up
grumblers and bring them to my old friend Santa
Claus before Christmas. If there’s anything he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
hates, it is grumbling, and he says he is going to
teach some folks a lesson this year.</p>

<p>“It’s no use to say a word—just follow me, and
be quick about it, too!” So off started Dame Quimp
with Farmer Jones behind her, grumbling as he
went.</p>

<p>She soon stopped short before a little house by
the roadside and listened a moment. There was a
sound of violent stamping, and an angry voice cried
out: “I hate that old dress and I won’t wear the
ugly thing! I never have any pretty clothes!” and
out on the porch rushed the milliner’s little daughter,
in a fine temper.</p>

<p>“Hoity-toity!” cried the dame. “You’re a pleasant
little girl, to be sure! Just the one I’m looking
for! Never mind asking ‘Why?’ but stop scolding at
once and fall in line behind Farmer Jones.”</p>

<p>The child looked crosser than ever and began to
cry, but she couldn’t help herself, and away went
Dame Quimp, Farmer Jones, and the milliner’s little
daughter.</p>

<p>As they neared the first corner, loud voices were
heard and angry tones, and there stood the baker’s
boy and the grocer’s clerk having a hot discussion.
“It’s too far!” cried the first. “I can’t tramp way
over on the hill for <i>anybody</i>! I hate to be sent on errands
from morning till night from one end of town
to the other!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” exclaimed the grocer’s clerk. “I’m
always being told to take something somewhere for
somebody just when I want a little time to myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
The skating’s fine to-day and I ought to get off
early, but I shan’t be allowed to. It’s a shame to
have to carry bundles instead of being on the pond!”</p>

<p>“Very well, young men!” cried Dame Quimp,
“you shall have a nice long walk. I’m very pleased
to meet you! Just step next in line to the little girl
and we’ll hurry along! No questions, please!”</p>

<p>So off went Dame Quimp, Farmer Jones, the milliner’s
little daughter, the baker’s boy, and the
grocer’s clerk.</p>

<p>As they passed the doctor’s house, the cook, in her
apron and cap, was standing at the gate grumbling
to the ice-man. “Shure an’ ’tis nothin’ but cook,
cook, cook, all day long, an’ meals havin’ to be kept
hot fer a man that’s niver in the house when he
ought to be! I’m that tired of wurruk that I’ve a
foine mind to tell him he may cook fer himself fer a
while!”</p>

<p>“All right, Bridget!” called Dame Quimp,
sharply. “You step off right now! Just take your
place next to the grocer’s clerk and we’ll move on!”
And away again went Dame Quimp, Farmer Jones,
the milliner’s little daughter, the baker’s boy, the
grocer’s clerk, and the doctor’s cook.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they came to little Tommy Brooks’s
house, and there was Tommy at the front door fussing
with his mother. “I don’t need any overcoat!”
cried he, “and I can’t wear rubbers,—they hurt my
feet,—and I left my mittens at school! I hate to be
bundled up just like a girl, anyway, and I wish
people would let little boys alone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Thomas Brooks!” called out the dame, severely,
“you put on that overcoat and those rubbers at once
and get behind the doctor’s cook—you’re the boy for
me! Step lively, now, all of you!” And off started
Dame Quimp, Farmer Jones, the milliner’s little
daughter, the baker’s boy, the grocer’s clerk, the
doctor’s cook, and little Tommy Brooks.</p>

<p>A little farther up the street the shoemaker’s wife
was grumbling to a neighbor, as she shook out her
duster on the porch. “I’ve no patience with housekeeping!”
declared the sharp voice. “I don’t do
anything but chase dirt from morning till night, and
yet the place is never clean—and my work is never
done. Yes, it <i>is</i> a comfortable and pretty house, but
I’m tired of the sight of it! I have to go and sweep
the dining-room this very minute!”</p>

<p>“Oh no! not at all!” cried Dame Quimp. “That
nice home of yours won’t get any more cleaning <i>this</i>
day! You can fall right in line behind Tommy
Brooks, and no remarks, if you please!”</p>

<p>So off they went again—Dame Quimp, Farmer
Jones, the milliner’s little daughter, the baker’s boy,
the grocer’s clerk, the doctor’s cook, little Tommy
Brooks, and the shoemaker’s wife.</p>

<p>At the turn of the road there was the sound of excited
talking and high words, and there stood the
minister’s twin grandchildren quarreling over a sled
and a pair of skates.</p>

<p>“I don’t want the old sled!” cried the boy. “I do
nothing but give you rides on it! You can just let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
have the skates, and drag the sled, yourself, for a
while!”</p>

<p>“Take the old skates!” answered the little girl,
angrily. “I can’t stand up on them, anyway, and I’m
tired of trying, and I don’t want the sled, either. I
wish people would give us some <i>nice</i> presents.
What’s the use of being twins if you can’t have a
good time?”</p>

<p>“Sure enough!” cried Dame Quimp. “Two nice
little children who can’t be happy with a fine sled
and a pair of new skates—I never heard of such a
thing! Come right here and take places behind the
shoemaker’s wife; and don’t cry about it, either,
for there’s no time to lose!” And away hurried
Dame Quimp, Farmer Jones, the milliner’s little
daughter, the baker’s boy, the grocer’s clerk, the
doctor’s cook, little Tommy Brooks, the shoemaker’s
wife, and the minister’s twin grandchildren.</p>

<p>Before long they came to the beautiful big house
where the banker lived, and there, just coming out of
the gate, they met the governess, looking much distressed
and almost in tears. “What can I do for you,
my dear?” asked Dame Quimp, anxiously; “you
seem to be in trouble. I’m the Grumble Collector, and
perhaps I can help you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you can,” said the governess, eagerly,
“if you will only tell me what to do with the
banker’s Dorothy. She has everything in the world
to please and amuse her, and yet she’s always in a
fret. As for clothes, she has so many pretty things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
that she can’t tell which she wants to wear. I ran
away just now because I was quite worn out with
her grumbling. I left her fussing over a pink, a blue,
and a green frock, trying to decide which to put on,
and in such a temper that she couldn’t look nice in
anything.”</p>

<p>“I see! I see!” replied the dame; “a very bad
case indeed! Just bring her to me at once and she
shall report to Santa Claus— Ah, here she is! Come
right along, Dorothy; you’re just the kind of little
girl needed in this procession! Stop fretting, directly,
and step in line behind the minister’s twin
grandchildren and we’ll move on!”</p>

<p>And away again went Dame Quimp, Farmer
Jones, the milliner’s little daughter, the baker’s boy,
the grocer’s clerk, the doctor’s cook, little Tommy
Brooks, the shoemaker’s wife, the minister’s twin
grandchildren, and the banker’s Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said the dame, as they reached the
end of the street; “I think I have heard that the
barber’s grandmother was a terrible grumbler—I
might try to find out.” So at a little house at the
corner they all waited while she knocked vigorously
at the door. It was opened quickly by a sharp-looking
little old woman who held on her arm a big
basket of mending.</p>

<p>“What do you want!” she said crossly. “I haven’t
time to say a word to anybody, so I can’t ask you
in. I’m just as fretted as I can be with all this mending
to do! I do think that after darning socks for
nearly fifty years I might be allowed to hold my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
hands for a bit; but every week here’s this great
basket full and nobody but me to attend to it. It
makes me so cross that I grumble over every pair of
the old socks—I wish they were in Guinea!”</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut!” replied Dame Quimp, sternly. “I
don’t know much about Guinea, but I do know where
<i>you’re</i> going! You’re the very one to finish my collection.
Set down that basket at once and put on a
warm cloak and hood and follow the banker’s Dorothy,
and we’ll go straight to Santa Claus—he’ll
be quite horrified to see such a string of grumblers!”</p>

<p>So off once more went Dame Quimp, with Farmer
Jones, the milliner’s little daughter, the baker’s boy,
the grocer’s clerk, the doctor’s cook, little Tommy
Brooks, the shoemaker’s wife, the minister’s twin
grandchildren, the banker’s Dorothy, and the barber’s
grandmother, all following behind her, one
after another.</p>

<p>They walked and they walked,—over the bridge
and past the mill; out beyond the golf-links; up one
hill and down another; across ploughed fields, and
through narrow woodland paths, till they were all
very tired and cold, and the barber’s grandmother,
being such an old woman, was quite worn out. Dame
Quimp, however, would listen to no complaints, but
kept them all strictly in line and hurried them on,
until, in a couple of hours’ time, they reached Christmas
Town.</p>

<p>They found Santa Claus in his shop busily engaged
in tying up delightful-looking parcels in gay
paper, with seals and labels, gold and silver cord,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
scarlet and green ribbons, and sprigs of holly scattered
around him in every direction.</p>

<p>“Good day, old friend!” cried Dame Quimp as
she entered. “I have done a good morning’s work,
as you see—all these are fine, first-class grumblers,
and not one of them deserves a Christmas gift. Let
me introduce them—here are Farmer Jones, the
milliner’s little daughter, the baker’s boy, the grocer’s
clerk, the doctor’s cook, little Tommy Brooks,
the shoemaker’s wife, the minister’s twin grandchildren,
the banker’s Dorothy, and the barber’s grandmother.
Take a good look at them so you will make
no mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, dear!” cried Santa Claus, in much distress.
“Is it really as bad as that! I never should
have thought you could find so many grumbly people
in a town full of pleasant things, with so much to
make them happy! I suppose I ought to give them a
severe lesson to check this terrible habit, but I’m
afraid, Dame, that I should quite spoil my own
Christmas pleasure if I were to pass them all by!</p>

<p>“What can be done about it? Don’t you think we
might let them off <i>this</i> time with a warning? I’m
sure you must already have given them a pretty
good scolding, for it seems to me you are getting
to be quite a grumbler yourself, and I have no doubt
you have been lecturing them all along the way.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have!” replied the dame, “and a thankless
job it was! They’re a troublesome lot, I tell
you, and you’d better not let them off too easily!
But, of course, you must suit yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Oh dear! Oh dear!” cried Santa Claus again,
as he tried to look sternly at the unhappy grumblers.
“This is very sad—very sad indeed! It is too near
Christmas for any one even to <i>look</i> cross, to say
nothing of scolding!” And here his round face broke
into a broad smile, and all the grumblers smiled,
too.</p>

<p>“See, Dame Quimp!” cried he, eagerly, “these
poor people are all in a good temper already, and
I feel sure that, if I trust them, they will try very
hard not to be grumblers any longer. Is it not so, my
friends?”</p>

<p>And Farmer Jones, the milliner’s little daughter,
the baker’s boy, the grocer’s clerk, the doctor’s cook,
little Tommy Brooks, the shoemaker’s wife, the minister’s
twin grandchildren, the banker’s Dorothy,
and the barber’s grandmother, all promptly answered,
“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Now hurry home as fast as you can,” said Santa
Claus, giving them each a big stick of candy. “You
have been gone so long that your friends will be
anxiously wondering where you are. Dame Quimp
and the barber’s grandmother will wait and have a
cup of tea with me, and I will take them home in my
sleigh a little later.”</p>

<p>There was a perfect chorus of thanks and promises,
a beaming smile from Santa Claus, a reluctant
grunt of farewell from Dame Quimp, and each member
of the grumbler procession set out at best speed
on the return trip.</p>

<p>It was late when they all reached home, but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
strange to say, with the exception of the doctor’s
cook, the baker’s boy, and the grocer’s clerk, not one
of them had been missed, for the various friends and
relations had been having such a delightfully quiet
and restful afternoon that they had forgotten all
about the departed grumblers.</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Beulah Marie Dix</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">“I want</span> to go,” said Justine Eliot, “where I won’t
even hear the word Christmas. If you’d only open
the camp, Doctor Sarah, we could stay there, just
by our two selves, until these ghastly holidays are
over. Oh, won’t you, please?”</p>

<p>Justine Eliot was nineteen, far richer in money
than she needed to be, and as pretty as a blush-rose.
Until a year ago she had known nothing but sunshine.
This fact Dr. Sarah Peavey took into swift
account, and she did not say, “Don’t be a coward!
Face it out!”</p>

<p>“You see, there were two of us a year ago,” Justine
went on, “and now I’m all alone. Oh, if I’d only
gone down-town that day with mother! But she said
it was a secret, and I wasn’t to come. And I said
I didn’t want to come, for I had a secret, too. It was
a pillow I was covering for her as a Christmas present—the
fir-balsam pillow that I’d made that summer
at the camp. I finished it that afternoon, and
tied it up with red ribbons. There were Christmas
wreaths in all the windows, and holly paper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
red ribbon everywhere. You know how mother loved
the Christmas season, and how she remembered
everybody. Oh, it was too cruel that she should leave
us then! And if I’d only been with her, I know it
wouldn’t have happened. But that crowded, slippery
crossing, and that automobile bearing down—and
I wasn’t there! I never want to see green holly
or red ribbons again. I think if I hear people say,
‘Merry Christmas!’ I shall die. And I wish I could!”</p>

<p>Justine broke into sobs, with her face in her hands.</p>

<p>For a moment Doctor Peavey watched her through
narrowed eyelids. Then she took a time-table from
the drawer of her desk, and said:</p>

<p>“I’ll leave my patients with Deering. I’ll telegraph
Serena Wetherbee to open the camp for us.
Meet me at the station to-morrow evening, and—”</p>

<p>“Doctor Sarah! Then you will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll take you where Christmas won’t find
you—if I can!”</p>

<p>Surely no better refuge could have been found
for Christmas fugitives than the camp on Nobsco
Head. Clad in black firs and bound with iron rock,
the headland thrust itself into the icy waters of the
bay. Half-buried now in the white drifts of winter,
the little house stood solitary—three miles by road
from the village of Crosset Cove, and a half-mile,
at least, from the little settlement known as Hardscrabble.</p>

<p>It was from Hardscrabble that Serena Wetherbee
came—a grim, gaunt woman, who not only had
lost three children, but had never learned from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
waves where they had flung the body of her sailor
husband. To warn her not to talk of Christmas
seemed superfluous. But on the fourth evening, while
they were all three sitting round the glowing airtight
stove in the camp living-room, Justine politely
asked Serena what she was knitting, and received
an unexpected answer.</p>

<p>“Christmas presents,” said Serena Wetherbee.
“A pair of mittens for Jacob Tracy, and striped
reins for his little sister Emmy. Haven’t you noticed?
He’s Heman Tracy’s boy, that brings the
milk over from Hardscrabble, and they’re poorer
than Job’s turkey. There’ll be a tree over at Hardscrabble
schoolhouse,—there always is,—and those
Tracy young ones shan’t go without presents, not
while I’m afoot.”</p>

<p>With a word of excuse and good night, Justine
rose and went to her room. But Serena Wetherbee
talked on:</p>

<p>“I don’t know, after all, if there’ll be a tree this
year at Hardscrabble. Have you seen the school-ma’am,
Doctor Sarah? She’s a Nash, from over in
Jefferson—one of those bred-in-the-bone old maids
that would turn cream sour just by looking at it.
Like as not she’ll set up for not having a tree to the
schoolhouse.”</p>

<p>But evidently Serena did not believe this dire
prophecy, for she was as horrified as Doctor Peavey
by the developments of the next day. The two women
were in the kitchen when small Jacob Tracy clumped
in out of the twilight, leading a sobbing little sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“Now you just shut up, Emmy Tracy!” Jacob
said, but not unkindly. “You ask Aunt Sereny and
she’ll tell you it ain’t so at all.”</p>

<p>Serena Wetherbee lifted the child to her lap.</p>

<p>“Tell aunty all about it, deary!”</p>

<p>“She says—teacher says—there ain’t—there ain’t
no Sa-anta Claus—and there won’t be a tree at
Hardscrabble—and no Christmas! And I’d wrote
Santa Claus—to bring me a dolly with hair—and
there ain’t—there ain’t no—”</p>

<p>“Teacher doesn’t know everything!” snapped Serena
Wetherbee.</p>

<p>With assurances and molasses cookies, the two
women comforted the child. She left the house with
a watery smile, but Jacob lingered to say:</p>

<p>“And do you think he’ll come to Hardscrabble,
for all she said?”</p>

<p>A few moments later, when Doctor Peavey passed
through the open door to the living-room, she found
Justine seated with a book at the table.</p>

<p>“What were they crying for?” asked Justine.</p>

<p>“Miss Nash, who teaches the school at Hardscrabble,
where the little ones go, told them that
there was no Santa Claus.”</p>

<p>“To tell a child that at Christmas time!” flashed
Justine. “She ought to be whipped!”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t help the children much,” said
Doctor Peavey, mildly, “or her, either.”</p>

<p>To Justine Doctor Peavey said no more, but she
took counsel with Serena. That evening, after Justine
had gone thoughtfully to bed, Doctor Peavey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
made out a list of the names and ages of the eighteen
children who went to the little school at Hardscrabble.
On the same sheet she made some tentative
calculations—so much for oranges, so much for
crinkly Christmas candy, so much for gifts, to be
bought at the ten-cent store at Hanscomville. It
was only a small sum, but, small as it was, it meant
that Doctor Peavey would go without the evenings
at the opera which were the one luxury of her winter.</p>

<p>The next morning, December 22d, Doctor Peavey
tucked her list into her pocket and started afoot for
Hardscrabble, where she planned to hire a horse and
pung from Cephas Tooke. She had bidden Justine
good-by for the day without explanation. A little
wholesome neglect would be tonic for Justine, she
believed; and she believed also that you may sometimes
attain your goal, like Alice in the Looking-Glass
country, by walking away from it.</p>

<p>She was to have speedy confirmation of her belief.
She had barely started down the shining hill slope
to the wood-path, when she heard the crackling of
a step behind her, and turned to see Justine, as
warmly bundled up as she was herself, with her
purse in her mittened hand. The color came and went
in Justine’s cheeks. For the moment she seemed
again the girl that Doctor Peavey had known in joyous
summers at the camp.</p>

<p>“Doctor Sarah!” Justine began, breathlessly. “I
didn’t mean to peep, but your writing is so big and
clear! I only glanced at your list by mistake, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
I knew in a minute, and I might have known anyway,
knowing you. But why didn’t you ask me to
help? Oh, you surely don’t think I’m like that horrible
Miss Nash? I don’t want Christmas for myself
ever again, but I wouldn’t take it away from other
people, and least of all from little children. So let me
help, please!”</p>

<p>For one second Doctor Peavey’s heart contracted.
She saw the purse in Justine’s hand, and she read
the passing thought in Justine’s mind. Would she
have to tell Justine that money alone could not buy
a Christmas gift, even of the poorest sort? But Mrs.
Eliot, as Doctor Peavey had often said, was one
of the finest women that she had ever known, and
Justine was her daughter.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Justine, with a little catch of the
breath. “You think that I should—” She slipped
the purse into her pocket. “Of course you can’t do
it all alone. Eighteen children!” she cried. “I’m
coming with you, Doctor Sarah!”</p>

<p>Together they trudged through the cathedral
gloom of the firs and over the dazzling whiteness of
the fields to Hardscrabble. Together they clambered
into the ramshackle pung and drove the nine bright
miles to Hanscomville. Such plans as they made on
that drive! They would have a tree set up in Serena
Wetherbee’s cottage, if the odious Miss Nash
still refused to let them have the schoolhouse. They
would string pop-corn and red cranberries by the
yard.</p>

<p>“And we’ll buy lots of sparkly snow and shiny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
doodaddles at the ten-cent store!” cried Justine.
Her eyes were as bright as Christmas stars.</p>

<p>“We’ll cut the candy-bags in the shape of stockings.
And we’ll buy a ‘dolly with hair’ for that wee
Emmy. I’ll have time to make it a dress and a petticoat,
at least. And I’m going to get a sled for Jacob
Tracy.”</p>

<p>So they planned all along the road, which seemed
short, and in Hanscomville they made the plans
come true. Up and down the little main street they
bustled, and made their purchases, Doctor Peavey
painstakingly, Justine with a lavish hand.</p>

<p>Presently they were stuffing packages into the
pung—bags of oranges and nuts and Christmas candies
from the grocer’s, bulging, frail bundles from
the ten-cent store, skates and pocket-knives—an extravagance
at which Doctor Peavey held up her
hands—from the hardware shop, and even lordly,
important-looking parcels from the general store.
Among the last was a doll’s carriage.</p>

<p>“It’s for Emmy’s doll,” said Justine, “and we
must find room for it, even if we have to tow it
behind the pung.”</p>

<p>On the way home they chatted about their Christmas
tree.</p>

<p>“It’s the sort of thing that mother would have
loved to do,” Justine said, and then she began
to talk about her mother, and to tell sweet,
homely incidents of the life that they had lived together.</p>

<p>They had passed through Crosset Cove when Doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
Peavey broke the not unhappy silence into which
they had lapsed.</p>

<p>“Justine! If we haven’t forgotten to get a present
for the schoolteacher!”</p>

<p>“For that Nash woman?” cried Justine. “She
doesn’t deserve a present. I shouldn’t like to say
what she does deserve.”</p>

<p>Then they reached the long tug of Nobsco Hill,
where, in mercy to the tired old horse, they got
out and walked. At the top of the hill they overtook
a woman, who was trudging on foot in the twilight.
She was thirty, perhaps, with a thin, tired face. She
wore a coat that was not thick enough, and a little,
old-fashioned neck-piece of worn fur. She was dragging
a small fir-tree through the snow, and every
little while she stopped to beat her numbed hands
together.</p>

<p>“I thought I knew everybody in these parts,”
said Doctor Peavey, under her breath, “but she’s a
stranger. Why, it must be Miss Nash!”</p>

<p>The woman turned as Doctor Peavey spoke to her.
Oh, yes, she would be glad of a lift, she said, in a
tired voice. She had been out getting a little tree
for her school children. She did not want them to
think that Santa Claus had forgotten them.</p>

<p>Doctor Peavey’s eyes, seeking Justine’s, read assent
in their softened expression.</p>

<p>“We were planning a little surprise for your
children,” she said, “but we’ll need help to put it
through. Couldn’t you spend the night with us, and
string cranberries and sew candy-bags?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>So the amazing thing came to pass—the odious
Miss Nash sat that evening at the camp table, and
worked swiftly to make real the Christmas plans.
So silent and so white she was that even Serena forbore
to sniff at her.</p>

<p>And a yet more amazing thing came to pass. The
next morning, when Doctor Peavey had prepared a
hot early breakfast for Miss Nash, and had set her
part way on her road to the schoolhouse, she returned
to camp to find Justine—the old Justine of
Nobsco summers—waiting to confide in her.</p>

<p>“She isn’t horrid at all!” Justine broke out.
“It’s Ellen Nash, I mean. After you sent us upstairs
last night and said that we must rest—did you
do it on purpose, Doctor Sarah?—she talked to me.
She said she hadn’t talked in months. It was the
picture, you know, there on my bureau. She asked
if it was my mother, and I—I told her how she died
a year ago. And then she told me. Doctor Sarah,
there are just she and her mother—and her mother
is at the sanitarium with tuberculosis. What chance
she has to get well is spoiled by her fretting to have
her daughter near her, and they have so little money
that that is out of the question. So Ellen Nash has
been trying to earn a little by teaching. On Wednesday
she got notice from the committee that she
wouldn’t be reëngaged for next term. And the same
day she had a letter from her mother—a pitiful
letter! That Christmas was coming, and they
couldn’t be together—that they would never be together!
And she says she guesses she was half-crazy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
but that morning, when little Emmy Tracy asked
her if Santa Claus would come this Christmas, she
answered right out of her heart that there wasn’t
any Santa Claus, and that all the talk about love
and Christmas fellowship was just a story. O poor
thing! I can understand! Why, Doctor Sarah, she
only went one little inch farther than I had gone,
and she is so much worse off than I. For my blessed
mother never suffered any, and we were together
up to the very last hour. Doctor Sarah!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Justine?”</p>

<p>“I—I haven’t been doing this year as mother
would have expected me to do.”</p>

<p>“That’s all over now,” said Doctor Peavey, heartily.
She hardly knew how truly she had spoken, but
she knew an hour later, when Justine again was
at her side.</p>

<p>“Doctor Sarah,” she said, with her old energy,
“can we go home to-night, on the night train?”</p>

<p>“What of our tree at Hardscrabble?”</p>

<p>“Of course we won’t disappoint the children.
We’ll write a letter, in the name of Santa Claus, and
ask them to Serena Wetherbee’s on Christmas day.
She says she’d be glad to have them. You wouldn’t
think, to look at her dear old granite face, that
she loved children so. And Ellen Nash will have the
tree and the presents all ready. O Doctor Sarah, it
would have made you cry to hear how she went
out to get a tree, and had even taken some of her
hard-earned money to buy nuts and apples for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
children, because she wanted to make up for what
she had said! But now they’ll have a sure-enough
Christmas at Hardscrabble, and we’ll go home.
There’s so much I must do, and only a day to do it
in! So many children that mother wouldn’t want
to have go unremembered! And you, Doctor Sarah,
you’re willing to go home?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Doctor Peavey.</p>

<p>It was a Christmas of bright sun and glad weather.
Sarah Peavey and her sister set crimson roses beneath
their mother’s picture and opened their gifts
in its presence. Sarah Peavey had the medical book
that she had needed, and a brown print of a Madonna,
and even a ticket for the opera. But the gift
that she valued most came in the twilight. The
telephone-bell rang, and over the wire came Justine
Eliot’s voice:</p>

<p>“Is it you, dear Doctor Sarah? I wanted to tell
you. I’ve seen my old cousin Hester. She’s tired of
hiring maids, you know, and she’s been looking for
a woman to be a sort of companion housekeeper in
her little apartment. I told her about Ellen Nash,
and she’s sending for her. She’ll pay her three times
what the Hardscrabble school paid, and Miss Nash
will be able to go often to see her mother. Doctor
Sarah!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Justine.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember my telling you about that
fir-balsam pillow I made up last year—the one I
thought I couldn’t ever touch again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“I remember, child.”</p>

<p>“I sent it off yesterday, in holly wrappings—to
Ellen Nash’s mother. And that’s all, Doctor Sarah,
dear, only—I wanted to wish you—Merry Christmas!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little boy in No. 60 pressed his nose against the
cold window-pane and looked out over the school
yard. It was a deserted white courtyard, with a few
muddy footprints zigzagging across the snow toward
the second dormitory. There was, to be sure,
a rusty puddle in one corner where the drops from
the rain-pipe spattered, but aside from that, four
gray walls with staring windows looked him back
square in the eye, no matter how far he twisted his
head.</p>

<p>The little boy had been ill. Even now, a bright red
flannel compress was wound about his tender throat,
and he was propped up in a much-too-big Morris
chair, with a plaid rug across his knees. There is
nothing to being sick at school—nothing at all. The
little boy in No. 60 could have told you that, because
he had had two months of it, and only now, at Christmas
time, had he begun to get well.</p>

<p>Of course, on the other hand, the infirmary is
good sport, with Mrs. Darling fussing over you and
feeding you hot broths from a little blue china bowl.
But even with Mrs. Darling tucking you in here
and patting you down there, and even with the boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
stumbling in for a few minutes to chatter about the
junior team and the senior squad, there is something
very “wantable” that you miss most fearfully
much. Something that begins with a capital
“M.” The little boy in No. 60 never let himself get
farther than the capital “M,” because his mother
was a whole ocean away, and it wasn’t any good
wishing for her anyway, you see, it cost so much
to come.</p>

<p>The little boy in No. 60 sat by the window a long
time, until the shadows began to get long and black
and reaching, and a crisp chilliness was in the air.
He wound the plaid rug tightly about him, until
only his sharp little chin peeked out, and he was
glad when he heard the door click and Mrs. Darling
rustled in.</p>

<p>“And was the little plum-pudding left all by himself?”
she asked, switching on the lights briskly.
“Such a busy day as it’s been—what with putting
the place to rights after the young gentlemen, and
getting the perfessers off for the holiday, why we
forgot all and everything about you. You’re not
cold, are you?”</p>

<p>“Not very,” said the little boy, quietly; “not very,
at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m having Nora build us a fire in the
study, and I’ll carry you down across my shoulder,
like the little pack of bones that you are.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could walk, if you—”</p>

<p>“Walk! And do you think I couldn’t lift you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
after caring for you two whole months? Mercy! but
the boy’s getting well!”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, she was bundling the plaid
about him and lifting him gently. There is something
rather revolting in having a woman carry you, just
like a tiny baby, and the little boy’s mouth stiffened,
and he stuck out his chin.</p>

<p>“Just as you like,” he said. “Only do be sure
nobody sees you doing it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling laughed aloud. “I’ll be so careful
that I’ll drop you like a hot potato if any one comes
sneaking around.”</p>

<p>And so the little boy in No. 60 was carried ignominiously
down the long stairs, his fair head resting
against Mrs. Darling’s plump shoulder.</p>

<p>Nora, down on her hands and knees, was piling
logs on a roaring fire. It did look cozy. The little boy
was almost glad he had come, only fires and crackling
logs somehow need a great laughing crew
about them. You really shouldn’t be at all lonesome
beside a fire, because it is such a big, warm, glorious,
friendly thing. Mrs. Darling set him down carefully
and stuffed a pillow behind his back. The little boy
quite hated the sight of a pillow, but he let it stay
because it <i>did</i> feel good in that spot, and then she
bustled away, for just “half a minute,” and left him
watching Nora, still poking and prodding the fire as
though she were trying to keep it awake.</p>

<p>Suddenly he spoke. “Nora,” he said, “what ever
are you crying for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Nora did not answer, but her shoulders began to
shake, and she dropped the poker.</p>

<p>“Nora, I guess perhaps I know why you’re crying,”
he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“O-o-h!” moaned Nora, her hands over her
face. “It’s homesick I am, and I’ve thried me bes’
niver to shid a tear, an’ now what’ll Mrs. Darlin’
say?”</p>

<p>“Never mind her,” he said soothingly. “Never
mind her at all. Perhaps, Nora, if you keep on crying,
I’ll cry too, and it wouldn’t be very good for
me, I don’t—believe.” There was the least bit of a
catch in his voice, and Nora swung around.</p>

<p>“For shame on me!” she cried, “whin it’s you
as should be mournin’—bein’ so sick an’ little an’
swate. Sure, an’ don’t you begin to cry, for Mrs.
Darlin’ will be blamin’ me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to,” he said quietly. “I’ll try very
hard. Nora,” he said, “have you a-a—m-oth—”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, shaking her head, “I’ve niver had
one—that is, since I was too schmall to remimber.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you homesick for?”</p>

<p>“It’s me brothers, and sisters, and their childer,
an’ the tree, an’ stockin’s,—an’—oh, it’s Christmas—”</p>

<p>“I see,” he said solemnly.</p>

<p>“Nora,” he added suddenly, “why couldn’t we
have a tree?”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ where’d we get it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, except where everybody gets trees—I
guess you buy them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, an’ they’re after costin’ a heap of money,
too.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” he said. Then he clasped his
hands. “Nora,” he said, “we simply <i>must</i> have
some kind of a tree, because, you see, it wouldn’t be
Christmas at all if we didn’t.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t nothin’ in the house that’d do for a
tree, I don’t suppose.”</p>

<p>“No—not unless—oh, Nora, the hat-tree! The
<i>hat</i>-tree!”</p>

<p>“The hat-tree, is it? A shiny mahogany tree? Oh,
it’s better than that we can do.”</p>

<p>“I believe,” his eyes were very bright—“I believe
that would do all right. Of course we’d have
to pretend it was a glorious tree that reached to the
ceiling, and that it was aglow with candles—and—and,
Nora, w-we could play I was the king, and you,
and Mrs. Darling, and old Patrick, and the cook
were poor subjects that I had invited in for the—the—feast;
and we could have apples—and stockings—and
nuts—and—”</p>

<p>“Sure, I don’t believe Mrs. Darlin’ will be lettin’
you do it.”</p>

<p>But just at that moment Mrs. Darling, bearing a
big tray, appeared.</p>

<p>“Guess what you’re going to have for supper to-night,”
she called across the cloud of steam that
rose, but the little boy was too eager to guess.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Darling!” he cried, “can’t we have a
Christmas party here? Can’t we have you and Nora
and Patrick and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“A Christmas party! And this Christmas eve!
Whatever are you thinking of? With Nora, and old
Patrick, and no tree or nothing—”</p>

<p>Something about the little boy’s face stopped her
short. Perhaps it was his eyes. You see, they had
grown very large and “wishful” since his illness,
and they had a way of speaking much more distinctly
than his lips. He did not say a word, but just watched
Mrs. Darling until she felt a big lump spring into
her throat.</p>

<p>“I guess we can manage it somehow,” she said
suddenly, “although I don’t see exactly how.”</p>

<p>The little boy clapped his hands.</p>

<p>“Let me do it!” he cried. “I’m going to pretend
that I am—well—a sort of a—” It was much easier
telling Nora things than Mrs. Darling. Some people
have such an understanding way.</p>

<p>“Sure,” broke in Nora, “it’s a king he’s goin’
to be, with us a-bowin’ an’ a-scrapin’ before him!”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind,” said the
little boy, apologetically, a pink flush mounting into
his pale cheeks. “You see, it would only be pretending,
and I—guess—perhaps—Patrick, and the cook,
and Nora wouldn’t mind pretending, on Christmas,
just this once, when it’s only a make-believe Christmas,
after all.”</p>

<p>“You can be as big a king as you want to,” said
Mrs. Darling, with a laugh, “if you eat the chicken
soup I’ve brought you and the buttered toast.”</p>

<p>The little boy sighed contentedly and obediently
tucked a napkin under his chin. He could feed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
now. He was very glad of that. But to-night his
hand trembled a bit, and he set down his spoon hastily.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I want any soup,” he said slowly,
but Mrs. Darling shook her head.</p>

<p>“Here, let me give it to you. And then you’ll have
time after dinner to think up what you are going to
do. I believe we could roast some of the chestnuts
Patrick picked up to-day.”</p>

<p>So the little boy drank each mouthful as quickly
as he could, and munched the toast without speaking
another word. After he had finished, Mrs. Darling
brought him a pad and pencil.</p>

<p>“Here, Your Majesty,” she said, smiling, “write
down your commands.” The little boy’s eyes brightened,
and he looked up at her shyly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mind playing it, do you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mind! Why, I guess it will do us all a world of
good, old as we are,” she said.</p>

<p>Of course after that, there was nothing for him
to do but to write down, in a shaky hand, his commands.</p>

<p>“Cut down the highest tree in the forest,” he
wrote first. “It must be so high and so strong that
it takes three men to chop it down. Then carry it
into the banquet-hall and set it up.” Here he
stopped. “Do you suppose we <i>can</i> have the hat-tree,
Mrs. Darling?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You can have anything you want,” she said
firmly.</p>

<p>“Order the Great-High-Tree-Trimmer, Sir Patrick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
to enter, and to hang the gold and silver bells
on the tree, and to light the candles— We can pretend
the hat-tree has candles on it, can’t we?” he
paused to ask.</p>

<p>“Of course we can,” she assured him.</p>

<p>“Then light the— What was it they burned at
Christmas, Mrs. Darling?”</p>

<p>“The Yule log.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Light the Yule log, and pile up the presents
under the tree—all kinds—whatever any one has
ever wished for in the world. Then hang the stockings
on the mantel, and let the Great-High-Filler,
Lady Nora, fill them with toys and books and—and—electric
engines. Then let the doors be flung open
and the guests enter. There!” he said, with a little
sigh, “that’s all.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough for to-night,” said Mrs. Darling,
looking at his flushed cheeks. “Just put your seal
to it.”</p>

<p>The little boy solemnly wrote “Rex,” just as he
had seen it done in books, and handed the paper to
Mrs. Darling with a smile.</p>

<p>“It will be a—a glorious—Christmas,” he said
bravely; “just a glorious one!” Then he leaned back
in his chair and closed his eyes, for he was suddenly
very tired.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Have you ever awakened on Christmas morning,
with the cold clear sunlight slanting across your
floor, and the blue sky peeking in your window, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
yet not even felt the least bit glad it <i>was</i> Christmas?
The little boy opened his eyes and looked around as
though he half expected to see a bursting stocking,
and to hear his moth— He jerked over on his side.
Even if it was Christmas morning, what was to prevent
a fellow from taking another nap! But something
hot and wet slid down his cheek, before he
could stop it, and, as long as there wasn’t any one
around, it didn’t make so much difference. But the
little boy brushed it angrily away and sat up in bed.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas!” he said fiercely to the table
in the corner. “Merry Christmas!” and he lay back
on his pillows with his eyes fixed on the ceiling and
his lip between his teeth. Somebody was whistling in
the lower corridor. He could hear it quite distinctly,
and it sounded so glad and cheerful that the little
boy slid to the floor, although his legs wabbled under
him, and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Hullo, down there!” he called over the banisters.
“Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Hullo, up there!” came back old Patrick’s crackled
voice. “Merry Christmas, Your Majesty.”</p>

<p>The little boy laughed out loud.</p>

<p>“Patrick, Patrick, do come up! How did you know
to call me that?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Your Majesty, I’ll be there as soon as I
mop up the last few steps. Git back into bed, and
I’ll come and pay you me respects.”</p>

<p>The little boy climbed back gladly under the warm
covers and waited for the old man, his eyes shining
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Patrick thumped heavily up the stairs, then
rapped loudly on the little boy’s door.</p>

<p>“You may enter,” said the little boy, stiffly,
though he did giggle just the least bit, for old
Patrick had pulled off his cap and shuffled in with
his head bent.</p>

<p>“The top o’ th’ mornin’ to Your Majesty!” he
said, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“The same to you, Sir Patrick. Have you cut
down the—the highest tree?”</p>

<p>“Sure, and it’s so high that I’m after thinkin’
the little people have bewitched it.”</p>

<p>“And—and where have they put it?”</p>

<p>“Right beside your throne, Your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the little boy, with a gasp, “I forgot
about having a throne! Isn’t that fine!”</p>

<p>“And the ceremonies are to begin immejetly after
your royal breakfast.”</p>

<p>“But, Patrick—Sir Patrick, I mean,—can we have
the chestnuts you picked?”</p>

<p>“Sure thirty men have been gatherin’ chestnuts
for Your Majesty since yesterday mornin’—and the
chief cook is roastin’ ’em on the kitchen stove.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh—and when can we have the feast?”</p>

<p>“Whin every one’s wished for whatever they
wants the most in the world,” said old Patrick, with
never a smile, “and not a minute before!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just that, Your Majesty; just that!” he said
solemnly as he backed out of the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait, Sir Patrick!” the little boy cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t wait, Your Majesty, for there’s much to
be done, includin’ shovelin’ the snow off the front
path.” And with a wave of his hand he was gone.</p>

<p>The little boy bombarded Mrs. Darling with questions
when she appeared with his breakfast.</p>

<p>“What did Patrick mean? When are we going to
begin? Oh, what ever does Patrick, and Nora, and
the cook want for Christmas? What do you suppose
I can give them that will make them ever so happy?”</p>

<p>“Help! help! Your Majesty!” cried Mrs. Darling,
putting her hands over her ears. But the little boy
persisted.</p>

<p>“Please, couldn’t I give them something?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Darling, importantly, “if you
won’t tell, I have a present for each one of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you had them to give yourself!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter who gives things, Your Majesty,
so long as people get them. It’s the getting
them that counts.”</p>

<p>The little boy nodded gravely. There was a great
deal in that. And he waited for Mrs. Darling to continue.</p>

<p>“There are a pair of heavy woolen mittens for
Patrick to keep his hands warm all winter, and for
Nora a red scarf of just the right shade to set off
her black hair and eyes. For the cook there is a
stout new pair of overshoes, hers being worn to the
very sole.”</p>

<p>But still the boy was not satisfied. Mrs. Darling
saw it in his eyes, and she guessed the reason.</p>

<p>“As for me,” she said carelessly, “I don’t expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
to get anything—let alone what I really want
and need most of anything in the world.”</p>

<p>“W-what <i>do</i> you need?” asked the little boy,
eagerly, entirely forgetting about his breakfast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling shrugged her shoulders. “It’s something
I have use for every day, and nobody could be
expected to think of it.”</p>

<p>The little boy hitched his shoulders impatiently.
“It’s fun telling what you want, anyhow,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I never can remember the things I
have to do without putting them down on a pad,
and I never have a pad handy. If only some one
would string some sheets of paper together for me
to scribble things on. But what’s the use of talking!
Whoever would think of such a thing!”</p>

<p>The little boy smothered a laugh the best way he
could, and tried to look very solemn while Mrs. Darling
lifted the tray off his knees.</p>

<p>“The packages have all got to be tied up, and,
although I haven’t a bit of red ribbon, pink and
blue will do every bit as well,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the little boy, “only—only don’t
come back for—about half an hour, will you? I want
to write—to—well, some letters, you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling nodded, and closed the door softly.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Of course, when you have only half an hour to
make a whole Christmas present, it behooves you
to hurry. The little boy reached over for his
dressing-gown and slipped his arms into it, then
drew on his slippers. He remembered his arithmetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
pad—or, rather, there <i>had</i> been an arithmetic pad
before he was taken ill—and it ought to be in his
desk drawer, behind the French Grammar. He
opened the drawer and pushed aside the French
Grammar with a shout, for there lay the pad! He
lifted it out, and, as he did so, something slipped
from its pages. It was a letter. He knew the writing,
even if he had not recognized the foreign stamp. He
stood very still, staring at it where it had fallen, a
white blur, on the floor. Then he winked his eyes
hard and picked it up.</p>

<p>“My darling little son,” it ran, “if I could only
be with you this—”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” he said huskily, “it costs so much to
come!” And he turned his back abruptly on the
desk without another word.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Darling knocked at the door, a short
time later, there was a long pause before a hurried
“Come in,” replied.</p>

<p>The little boy looked very uncomfortable, as
though he were just about to be caught doing something
he shouldn’t do, and there was a look about
one of his pillows as though something had been
hastily stuffed beneath it. Mrs. Darling’s arms were
full of packages and paper, besides a quantity of
pink and blue ribbon which gave her very much the
appearance of a Maypole.</p>

<p>“Will Your Royal Majesty fasten up the presents
now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the little boy, gravely; “but how
about the stockings? There must be stockings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“The stockings are already hung by the mantelpiece
in the study, just as Your Majesty commanded,
and Lady Nora is filling them with fudge and nuts
and apples, besides a sprinkling of ginger-cookies,
that she made at the last minute.”</p>

<p>“O-o-oh!” cried the little boy; “how splendid!”</p>

<p>“And Sir Patrick is trimming up the tree with
great boughs of evergreen.”</p>

<p>The little boy’s face was radiant.</p>

<p>“And nobody knows what they’re going to get?”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” said Mrs. Darling; “although
I heard Nora wishing for a red scarf a few minutes
ago.”</p>

<p>Then the little boy set to work. There are any
quantity of ways to tie up Christmas presents so
that they will look as though they were full of your
heart’s desire. Of course to do that you must have
tissue-paper that is soft and crinkly, and red, red
ribbon, besides a sprig of holly to lay across the top.
The little boy had only stiff brown paper, but it
did very well, for it bulged out in places where it
shouldn’t have, and made the packages look a great
deal more imposing than they really were.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling insisted on his getting dressed after
that. There was a very best suit in the closet that
he had not worn for weeks, and he slipped it on, although
it hung rather loosely upon him.</p>

<p>“Kings always have to dress up,” she explained;
“that’s one of the worst things about being a king.”
So the little boy submitted to having his hair
brushed and his face washed, although he would a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
great deal rather have been left alone to finish his
present.</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t go down into the study until
the feast is ready,” she said. “You see, every one
is getting dressed for it, including old Patrick himself,
so as to be fit to enter the banquet-hall.”</p>

<p>The little boy nodded. He understood exactly how
one must appear before a king, and he felt just a
little sorry for Patrick and the rest. Mrs. Darling
gathered up the packages.</p>

<p>“Nora is going to hang them on the tree,” she
explained, “and when the guests have all assembled,
why, then I’ll send the heralds to escort you
to your court.”</p>

<p>After Mrs. Darling had left him, he sat still a
long time, listening to the hum of voices in the lower
corridor. There was an excitement in the air, something
that seemed to hum and throb and thrill. Perhaps
it was the sweet smell of the cranberry sauce
that was wafted up to him, or perhaps it was Nora’s
shrill whispering, but it was there—a great unknown
<i>something</i> that sent the little boy’s pulses leaping.</p>

<p>After a while, he heard some one stamping up the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Sure and is the king ready for the feast?” called
out Patrick’s voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes!” said the little boy, breathlessly;
“but, Patrick, Patrick, do hang this on the tree for
Mrs. Darling, won’t—”</p>

<p>He stopped short, for at his door stood a bowing
Patrick in a shabby black suit, and a curtseying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Nora in a bright blue dress. Between them they held
a cushion. The little boy recognized it. It was one
of the green plush cushions from the headmaster’s
couch, and he laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“If you’ll be climbin’ on the pillow,” said Nora,
as they lowered it between them, “we’ll be carryin’
you to the feast.”</p>

<p>Somehow when the little boy—white and fair and
eager—was perched on the cushion, he did look like
a flaxen-haired little king, between two loyal subjects.
It was a very serious matter to him, and although
his mouth would curl at the corners when
they fell out of step, his eyes were very grave, and
he bowed his head first to Mrs. Darling, then to the
cook, who awaited him at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the king!” shouted old Patrick
at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>“Three cheers!” they called.</p>

<p>“Let the king make a speech,” cried Patrick, and
Mrs. Darling echoed, “Speech!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the little boy. Then he recovered himself,
and his eyes wandered over their heads, beyond,
to the closed door. “Dear, dear people,” he said,
in a hurried, breathless sort of way, “may this be
the—the—merriest Christmas you have ever had.
May you get whatever you want—even if it is the
impossiblest thing in the world—even if it—it—costs
so much—”</p>

<p>“Ah hah!” cried Patrick quite forgetting that a
king must never be interrupted, no matter how long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
he takes. “Ah hah, it’s a pair of gloves I’m wishin.’
for, but never a glove will I get!”</p>

<p>“And as for me,” cried Mrs. Darling, “His Majesty
is the only one who knows what I want, and
that’s quite enough, seeing it’s such a hopeless
thing!”</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful rid shawl I’m after wantin’,”
sighed Nora; “but it’s niver a rid shawl I’ll see this
Christmas—”</p>

<p>“And I need a pair of overshoes the worst way,”
said the cook, smiling; “but whoever would think of
that!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the little boy, his eyes shining with
gladness. “Oh! now we can surely go to the feast,
for every one’s wished for what they want most in
the world—do hurry and open the door!”</p>

<p>“Wait!” said old Patrick, raising his hand, “I
haven’t heard His Majesty askin’ for a thing—I—”</p>

<p>“But kings, Patrick—kings don’t ever <i>get</i> things,
they all the time <i>give</i> them!”</p>

<p>“This is Christmas, Your Majesty, and before
that door is opened, every one, king included, wishes
for the thing he wants most. Quick now—what’ll
you have?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the little boy, suddenly shrinking,
“please—<i>please</i>—”</p>

<p>“Go on, Your Majesty,” said Patrick, firmly, “for
until you wish the feast stays on the other side of
the door.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh—” the little boy covered his face, “I—I—mustn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
even think about it—and—and I’m trying—”</p>

<p>“Is it a ball you’re wantin’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“A steam-engine?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“A pair of boxin’-gloves?”</p>

<p>“No—no—<i>no</i>! It’s—my—mother—I want!” he
said, with a sob.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Patrick, flinging the door open suddenly,
“and why couldn’t you have said that long
ago, instid of keepin’ her sittin’ here and waitin’
for you full half an hour—”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Late that night, after Nora, with her red scarf
over her shoulders, had gathered up the remains of
the Christmas feast, and only a low, red, cozy light
gleamed beneath the burnt-out logs, the little boy
raised his head from his mother’s shoulder and laid
his hand on her cheek.</p>

<p>“But it cost so much to come!” he said softly,
with a little shake in his voice. She drew him down
in her arms, with a way mothers have.</p>

<p>“Look!” she whispered, “there’s the last spark!
“Wish—quick—wish!”</p>

<p>“I wish,” he said slowly, “—I wish every girl
and boy in the world has had as happy a Christmas
as I have. I wish—”</p>

<p>But he didn’t get any farther, for the tiny red
spark went out quite gently, as if it did not want at
all to disturb the little boy in No. 60 and his mother.</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Harriet Prescott Spofford</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had always kept Christmas at home, even if
in no very expensive way. On the very last one,
Johnny had had his skates, tied to his stocking, and
inside it, an orange and nuts and raisins, and some
little trick-joke, and a stick of candy; and Robby had
had his sled, and Marnie her book, and Bessie her
tea-set; and Mr. Murtrie, the father, had a pair of
wristers that Nancy had crocheted, and a muffler
that his wife had knit; and the mother had a needle-book
that Marnie had made, and a bread-plate that
Johnny had whittled out, and a piece of jig-saw
work from Robby, and a muff from the father. And
Marnie had written a poem to Father and Mother,
which all the others criticized violently and ruthlessly,
but which was privately regarded as a great
achievement by every one of them.</p>

<p>But what was there to do here with sleds and
skates! Great use for a muff out in the middle of the
Texas prairie, to which they had come from the
North. Why, yesterday the thermometer was just at
summer heat, and roses were blossoming!</p>

<p>At home how gay it was with every one coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
and going, with purchases and parcels and merry secrets,
with the hanging of the green, with big snow-drifts,
and coasting down Long Hill by starlight,
with going to church in the forenoon, and coming
home to turkey and cranberry sauce, and a pudding
in blue flames! Here there was nothing, there was
nobody. There wasn’t a shop within a hundred miles,
and if there were, there was no money with which
to buy anything. For Mr. Murtrie had come to grief
in his business, losing, when all debts were paid,
everything but this ranch, to which he had brought
his family, and where it seemed like a new world.</p>

<p>At first, it had been so novel, no one thought of
homesickness. Nancy herself had enjoyed as much
as any one the singing of the mocking-birds at night,
the flashing of the cardinal’s red wings in the radiant
mornings and the bubbling of his song, the fragrance
of the jasmines, the beauty of the innumerable
flowers, the charm of the wide landscape, the
giant trees draped in their veils of gray moss; she
had enjoyed hearing the boys tell about the batcaves,
with their streams of unnumbered wings going
out by dark and coming in by dawn in myriads;
she had enjoyed lying awake at night to hear the
water gently pouring through the irrigation ditches
from the <i>madre</i> ditch, and drowning all the land in
its fertilizing flood to the sound of slow music; she
had enjoyed watching the long flights of wild ducks;
seeing a spot apparently covered with yellow flowers
that suddenly turned into a flock of birds that rose
and flew away. She had enjoyed the strange cactus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
growths that seemed to her like things enchanted in
their weird shapes by old magicians; she had enjoyed
the thickets of prickly pear, the green and
feathery foliage of the mesquit bushes, many of them
no higher than her head, but with mighty roots
stretching far and wide underground, the Indians
having burned the tops in their wild raids, year
after year, long ago. But now Nancy was longing
for the bare branches of her old apple-tree weaving
their broidery on the sky, for the young oak by the
brook which held its brown leaves till spring, for
the wide snow-fields, the shadows of whose drifts
were blue as sapphire. She was longing to hear the
bells ring out their gladness on Christmas eve and
Christmas morning, for the spicy green gloom of the
church, for all the happy cheer of Christmas as
she had known it. Bells? There wasn’t a bell within
hearing; there wasn’t a church, except the ruins of
an old Spanish mission three or four miles distant.
How could there be Christmas green where there
wasn’t a spruce or a fir! There was only this long,
dreary prairie of the cattle-range under its burning
blue sky. It was the very kingdom of loneliness.
Christmas without snow, without an icicle, without
whistling winds,—oh, it wasn’t Christmas at all!</p>

<p>And then suddenly, as the angry words resounded
and echoed in her mind, she asked herself what made
Christmas, anyway? Certainly it wasn’t the things
people did. In some places they kept it with blowing
of horns and burning of fire-crackers, as they did
Fourth of July. Perhaps in that way they expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
as much gladness as others did with the pealing
from belfries and the rolling of organ tones. For
Christmas was a time to be glad that Christ came
to make all Christendom good, and blessed, and
happy.</p>

<p>And, just as suddenly, Nancy could not help asking
herself what she was doing to express gladness
or to make Christmas happy. North pole or south
pole, Christmas was Christmas, and it wasn’t all in
pleasure or all in gifts; and she got out of bed, and
knelt down and said a prayer, and went to sleep in
a better frame of mind.</p>

<p>But if it wasn’t all in pleasures or all in gifts,
there must be <i>some</i> gifts; and next day, Nancy set
herself to thinking out the problem. It was still
some time before the great holiday, and every hour
must be improved.</p>

<p>For the first thing, she betook herself to one of
the men on the range who often came about the
buildings; and he found for her several huge horns,
and, with his help, and taking Johnny into her confidence,
they took grease and brick-dust and scraped
and polished these horns till they shone almost like
silver. Then the three dug for a big mesquit root
and secured one, at last, that grew from a great
stock; and they scraped and polished that into a
very handsome piece of wood; and, having a little
knack of carpentry, they fitted the enormous horns
into the mesquit root, and there was a chair for
any palace. It was to be their father’s, and was to
stand on the gallery, where, some night, the night-blooming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
cereus that laced the whole front would
open its slow, delicious flowers, and shed the balm
of heaven about him.</p>

<p>They found it a little difficult to keep this secret,
because they began work upon it before Mr. Murtrie
went off on his hunting-trip with some friends;
but after he had gone, things were easier, as the
mother was not inclined to prowl about and look
into everything, as the head of a house sometimes
thinks necessary.</p>

<p>And for the mother,—they knew where some tall
flat grasses grew, near a stream that was brimming
at this season, and Johnny waded in and got them.
Nancy plaited them into a low work-basket, and
lined it with a bit of silk that had been her doll’s
skirt in her day of dolls. The doll, that had been religiously
put away, was taken from her slumbers
and furbished for Bessie’s Christmas. “Why, really,
it’s going to be a Christmas, after all,” she said.</p>

<p>“Only it’s so queer to have it so warm,” grumbled
Johnny. “Winter without snowballing isn’t
winter!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Nancy, beginning to defend
the thing she had adopted.</p>

<p>The man who had found the horns for her found
also a little baby fox, and that was kept in great seclusion
to become, on Christmas morning, a pet for
Johnny; and Marnie and Nancy had great times together
feeding it. He had the funniest little bark already.
“Oh, we are coming along!” cried Nancy.</p>

<p>But there was more to be done. She remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
that once, when her father had taken her to see the
ruins of the old mission, she had observed a number
of Mexican “shacks,” or huts, near by. She saw
the dinner of one family, which consisted of half
a sweet-potato and a red pepper. But she had also
seen a big cage full of canarios. And so Nancy and
Johnny set out to walk over to the mission, losing
their way several times, but finding it again all at
once. There an Indian woman, who was about thirty
years old and looked a hundred, flung her baby,
which was the loveliest little harmony of brown and
rose you ever saw, into her husband’s arms, and,
after a great deal of pantomime and dumb show,
sold, for the price of the last piece of silver in
Nancy’s purse, a pair of the canarios in a cage made
of reeds, each one an exquisite pinch of feathers,
a lot of living gems, of all colors of the rainbow,
blue, and yellow, and green, and purple, and red,
and brown—iridescent little things, with a song like
the faintest, prettiest echo of a Hartz canary’s song.
And there was Marnie’s Christmas present settled.</p>

<p>But for Robby? Oh, there was the horned toad
she had heard about. Robby had seen one in some
show or other at home, and had longed for it. Here
it was to his hand,—if she could find it. And with the
help of the man who had helped her before, and who
could not fancy what she wanted it for, find it she
did. Robby would be delighted.</p>

<p>If Nancy had been born in the region, or was living
in any town there, she would have found no difficulty
in making Christmas presents like those she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
had hitherto given; but these gifts that she found
possible were unique and unlike anything she could
have obtained at her old home.</p>

<p>And now for sweetmeats. Well, they had dried
some of the luscious grapes and there were the raisins
in the pantry, just oozing and crusted with
sugar; and there was the barrel of molasses from
the sugar-mill down on the Brazos; no one could
make more delicate candy than Nancy could and
did; and there had been a great harvest of pecan-nuts;
and thus, so far as the stockings were concerned,
Christmas had no more to ask.</p>

<p>The expected day was close at hand, and Nancy
pictured to herself how it would all go off—how the
stockings would be hung up, how Johnny would help
with the chair and then be in bed before his own
gift appeared, and how she would be up at the peep
of dawn to go out and bring in that baby fox—the
delicate, delicious, dewy dawn—and make his bed
under Johnny’s stocking, tying his leash to the
toe, after fastening it securely to a hook in the
chimney; and how she would untwist and unbind and
unlace a great bunch of the roses outside that were
having a late blossoming on their luxuriant growth,
and bring it into the window and train it all around
the room under the ceiling. It would be—well, as
beautiful as the Christmas green; it couldn’t be
more beautiful, she said in her thoughts.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Mrs. Murtrie began to be
a little anxious about her husband. He should have
returned from his hunting-trip some days before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and he was still absent, no one could say where. And,
of course, she was conjuring up all sorts of frightful
possibilities in the way of accidents, and Marnie
was helping her; and Nancy herself, although ordinarily
holding her father to be invulnerable, felt a
degree of alarm as she thought what if he had fallen
into some gulch, or lost his way, or drowned in one
of the rivers that rose, after a rain in the hills, so
swiftly that, in a town below, a man had been overtaken
before he could get off the bridge. As for
Johnny, he was for going out to find his father, if
he only knew which way to go. As night fell, and
it was Christmas eve, the house was full of a sort
of electric tension; no one said just what every one
was thinking, till suddenly Bessie broke out with
a great sob, and cried: “I want my papa!” Then
every one fell to comforting her, and all were furtively
wiping away tears, when steps rang on the
gallery, the door burst open, and the father, with his
blue eyes shining out of his browned skin, and his
great voice resonant, stood before them, holding an
immense bird with wide-spreading wings.</p>

<p>“It’s a wild turkey,” he said, after the uproarious
greetings, and as soon as they loosened their
embraces. “I was resolved not to come back without
a turkey for Christmas. And it’s a great deal
richer and sweeter than any home-made bird, as
you’ll see when it’s roasted.”</p>

<p>A turkey! And Nancy had but lately been bemoaning
herself that the dinner would be without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
a turkey. She had gone to bed, and so did not see
her mother seize the wings of the wild trophy, and
trim them, and run out to the kitchen to the adjacent
building and dry them well in a hot oven, and
later trim them again, and bind them at the base
with the palms of an old kid glove and so
finish for Nancy’s Christmas as fine a feather fan
as one could wish to wave on a hot summer afternoon.</p>

<p>But at last, when the house was quite still, Nancy
crept out of her room and summoned Johnny to
help her with the chair. Johnny was too sleepy not
to be glad to be dismissed after that, and then she
disposed of the presents exactly as she had planned,
and wondered what the large parcel was, swinging
by a string from her own stocking, and went to sleep
to the tune of the song a mocking-bird sang, sweet,
and strong, and joyous, in the pecan-tree outside,
till a rising wind swept it away. And if you could
have looked into the living-room of that bungalow
next morning, you would have seen Johnny hugging
his baby fox, and Bessie hugging her doll and Marnie
chirping to her birds, and their mother putting
spools, and needles, and scissors into her work-basket,
and the father taking his ease in his big chair
with its shining supports, and Nancy leisurely fanning
herself, as if there were not a norther blowing
outside, which, had the casements been open, would
have blown the rain quite across the room. Rain?
No, oh, no! For, see! look! For a wonder, the loveliest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
silveriest, soft snow was falling, which, even
if it melted to-morrow, made Nancy’s northern heart
feel, in her southern home, the spirit of Christmas
everywhere.</p>

</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Sarah Addington</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed to Jerry that he would really die if he
didn’t get a book that Christmas. Here he was, eight
years old, learning to read, liking to read better
than almost anything else in the world, and he had
no book to read from. He read at school in books
furnished by somebody or other, Jerry didn’t know
who, but that wasn’t enough. Jerry wanted a book
for his very own. He wanted it big enough to carry
under his arm, and small enough to put under his
pillow at night. He wanted it to have stories in it
about bears and St. Bernards and dragons and boys—no
girls; stories, too, about snakes and explorers
and boats and soldiers. He wanted the book to have
red and yellow and green pictures of airplanes and
lions and pirates, one picture on every page.</p>

<p>This was the book Jerry wanted. This was the
book he dreamed of in bed at night and thought
about in the daytime, the book he pretended to carry
under his arm and made believe was under his pillow.
But there wasn’t the slightest chance of Jerry’s
getting that book, or any book. Indeed, Jerry would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
have been ashamed to mention the word “book” at
home. People don’t talk airily about blue-and-gold
books when their mothers don’t have enough breakfast
and their fathers don’t have enough supper
and nobody in the whole family ever has enough dinner,
even on Sunday.</p>

<p>And that was the appalling state of affairs at the
Juddikins’. Nobody ever mentioned it, but there it
was. They hadn’t enough food, they hadn’t enough
fire, they hadn’t enough clothes. There were five
Juddikins: Mr. Juddikins, Mrs. Juddikins, Jerry
Juddikins, the baby Juddikins, and Mutt Juddikins,
who, though he was only a dog and, as dogs go,
not of high social position, yet was a highly important
member of the Juddikins family. He was
a mutt dog, the Juddikins frankly called him Mutt,
yet this dog was far from a mutt at heart. Indeed,
he had a thoroughbred soul, such as some of your
blue-blooded aristocratic dogs never dream of
having. He never whined when he was hungry, like
the fussy little Pomeranian next door. He didn’t
need a silk pillow to sleep on, like the lazy Pekingese
across the street. Not much. Mutt was a real
sport. He took what he got, which wasn’t much,
but it was always all that the Juddikins could give
him; bread and gravy, potatoes sometimes, even
a bone now and then, a skimpy, dry bone, to be sure,
but none the less a bone. Mutt took these and was
grateful and happy, even put on airs as if it were
a feast that the Juddikins had set before him.</p>

<p>For Mutt was not only a sport, he was also a swell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
He carried his tail at the most elegant angle. He
picked up his feet with style and dignity. His were
drawing-room manners. He had shameful ancestors;
his grandfather on his mother’s side had been a
mere roustabout dog, one of those villains who spend
their lives fighting and stealing and cheating man
and beast alike. Mutt remembered him well; he had
died in a brawl which was the talk of the alley for
days. Then there was Mutt’s grandmother on his
father’s side, a dissolute old dog who ate a cat a
day when she was home, and who, when she wasn’t
home, wandered abroad pillaging and plundering
like a very pirate among dogs. She dined on garbage
and slept in ash cans. Mutt’s own mother was far
from a lady, his father was a brute, and their home
life was deplorable.</p>

<p>And yet along came Mutt, their descendant, a gentleman
if not a scholar, a dog well-mannered, refined,
gallant, heroic. The last of a long line of ruffians,
thieves, bullies and traitors, Mutt was a
cavalier among dogs, and he lived with the Juddikins
and was the very center of their small and
humble universe.</p>

<p>Some people said the Juddikins ought not to keep
Mutt: they were too poor. But, as Mrs. Juddikins
said, when you’re poor you need a dog the most of
all, and as for giving up Mutt, rich or poor, the Juddikins
would as soon have considered giving up the
baby, I do believe. Of course the baby was very sweet
and cunning, but Mutt was far more intelligent, and
one thing he didn’t do, he didn’t swallow buttonhooks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>and hairbrushes all day long, as the foolish
Juddikins baby tried to do.</p>

<p>The Juddikins would have been a very happy family,
then, if only they hadn’t been so poor. But they
were poor. There was hardly any money at all in
Mr. Juddikins’ pocket, none at all in Mrs. Juddikins’
pocket, less than none in the brown box on the
mantelpiece, for there, where the money used to be,
were now only bills. Bills for the rent of the Juddikins’
tiny house, bills for the doctor—for once the
baby really swallowed part of the hairbrush, and
old Doctor Jollyman had to come running and fish
out the bristles.</p>

<p>It was all because Mr. Juddikins didn’t have a
job. Fathers have to have jobs, it seems, to keep
families going, and Mr. Juddikins didn’t have one,
so his family wasn’t kept going very well. It scared
Mr. Juddikins half to death sometimes to think that
the whole family depended on him like this. Mrs.
Juddikins, Jerry Juddikins, the baby Juddikins,
Mutt—all had stomachs to fill, all had bodies to be
warmed at the fire, and this not to mention Mr. Juddikins,
who was hungry and cold himself all the
time.</p>

<p>Every morning Mr. Juddikins would start out to
look for a job. First he would rise early and call
everybody. “Get up, mother! Get up, Jerry! Get up,
baby!” Mutt was the only one who didn’t have to
be told to get up. Then Mr. Juddikins would bustle
around and make a fire, oh, a very small one, and
while Mrs. Juddikins was making the tea, oh, a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
small pot, Mr. Juddikins would put on his clean collar
and his stringy black tie, and sing as he looked
at himself in the mirror. Mr. Juddikins was, you
see, of a cheerful disposition. If he had not been, he
could never have sung as he looked at himself in
the mirror. Mr. Juddikins would then take his tea.
He made dreadful faces over the tea, for he didn’t
like it without milk and the Juddikins had no milk,
except the baby, who had nothing else, unless you
count the bristles.</p>

<p>After drinking tea and making faces for a while,
Mr. Juddikins would put on his shabby hat and his
skimpy overcoat, kiss them all around and go off. In
one pocket he carried a bit of lunch, in the other
a letter of recommendation. In his heart Mr. Juddikins
bore a strange and thrilling hope: Today he
would get the job, and henceforth all would be rosy
and jolly for the Juddikins family. But somehow to-day
was never the day, and every night Mr. Juddikins
would come home tired and discouraged, his
cheerful eyes clouded, his smile gone, his perky tie
sagging at a most dejected angle. It was all very
bad, and Jerry felt so sorry for his father. Book indeed!
What kind of boy would he be to mention book
at a time like this?</p>

<p>Jerry went to school on Peppermint Place. It was
a lovely school, where canaries sang in little glittering
cages and geraniums bloomed like red soldiers
in straight rows at the windows, and where in winter
a fire boomed in a big, deep fireplace, and in summer
the peppermint trees flung white-blossomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
arms in at the windows. Were they really peppermint
trees? I confess I don’t know. The grown-ups
said not, and called them lindens and catalpas and
chestnuts. But the children said they were: else why
should the square be called Peppermint Place?
Grown-ups have a tiresome way of being right about
things like that, yet why should a square be called
Peppermint Place if the trees aren’t peppermint
trees? Moreover, the children said that if you went
to the square at midnight the flowers were peppermint,
and they said they could smell them in the early
morning when they first got to school—a left-over,
faint, but delicious smell that was nothing if it was
not peppermint blossoms washed over with midnight
dew. Nobody had ever been at Peppermint
Place at midnight, so nobody could really deny what
the children said. So I am inclined to believe that for
once the grown-ups were wrong, and that the trees
were really peppermint—at midnight anyway.</p>

<p>From nine to ten the children at this school read
and did arithmetic problems. Jerry had struggled
from nine to ten many mornings with the queer
marks in his primer, until, lo, one morning he found
he could read—all as sudden and surprising as that.
From ten to eleven they sang and drank cocoa and
played games around the fire. From eleven to twelve
they took naps, then read some more, and looked up
cities and rivers on the big globe over by the red
soldiers in the window, and wrote on the blackboard.
From twelve to one they played in the garden behind
the school. This was a special garden, just for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
children. It had signs up like these: “Parents and
Dogs Not Allowed”; “Please Walk on the Grass”;
“Trespassing Allowed.” And at one o’clock the
children went home.</p>

<p>Jerry loved school. He loved the reading and the
cocoa and the geraniums on parade, though he did
wonder sometimes about those geraniums. Didn’t
they get tired of just being dressed up and parading,
and long to break ranks and have a good fight? Even
toy soldiers have wars; these were such peaceful
soldiers. But you can’t fight if you don’t have any
enemies, and the geranium soldiers didn’t. Everybody
loved them; consequently their life was one
long peace. Jerry liked the boys at school, too—Peter
the Little, and Johnnie O’Day, and the Bumpus
twins who had such interesting pockets, fishing
worms and marbles and snake skins and arrows and
tops and kite strings and magnets, all in one inviting
jumble. He even liked the butterflies on top of
the girls’ heads, pink and brown and red ribbons
that perched there and looked always ready to
fly.</p>

<p>But he didn’t like the girls. He simply couldn’t stand
the girls. Girls swished their skirts, for one thing,
the important silly creatures; swished them into the
room and down the aisles, and even when they got
safely into their seats they swished and fidgeted and
squirmed around, spread out those skirts in wide
circles around them, and patted them down in such
an utterly silly way. They snickered, too, all the time.
Hee, hee, hee! Tee, hee, hee! Jerry could positively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
hear them in his sleep; he could see them in the dark,
putting up small hands before their faces, hee-heeing
and tee-heeing behind them, and rolling foolish eyes
around. Also, they were cowards and cravens—squealed
at the sight of a spider, couldn’t climb a
tree worth a cent, sniffled when their feelings were
hurt. A detestable tribe, girls!</p>

<p>Jerry used to wonder if his baby sister would grow
up to be one of them, swishing her skirts and giggling
and sniffling. Most likely. Anybody that would
eat hairbrushes would no doubt grow up just as
silly. And he used to wonder, too, how it was that
women like his mother and the teacher, such utterly
lovely people as they now were, had ever been just
girls. Could his teacher really have been like these?
Did she never throw a ball right, or climb a tree decently,
or carry a toad in her pocket? Oh, yes, toads!
The girls said they made warts. Fancy that, if you
can. Warts! And supposing toads did make warts,
who cared? No, Jerry couldn’t endure girls, and that
was why he didn’t want a single girl in his whole
book when he got it, if he ever did get it. A world
without girls was impossible, it seemed; there were
such hordes and swarms of them; but a book without
girls was entirely feasible, and that was the kind
of book Jerry wanted.</p>

<p>And then one day, two weeks before Christmas,
it suddenly began to look as though Jerry might
get his book after all. It was the teacher’s idea, and
when she had suggested it Jerry wondered why in
the world he hadn’t thought of such a simple thing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
The teacher said: “Now today we’re going to write
our letters to Santa Claus. Peter, you pass the
pencils, please, and Katinka may distribute the
papers. And you must all tell Santa just what you
want, and don’t forget commas and periods. Santa
Claus is very partial to commas and periods. Last
week Katinka wrote a whole page without a single
comma. I can’t think what made her.”</p>

<p>Katinka, who was passing papers blushed guiltily,
and Jerry, though he hated girls, felt a little sorry
for her. Katinka was hardly as odious as most girls.
She had reddish short curls, and she wore green
butterflies on them. She was fattish, her face was usually
sticky from lollipops, her aprons were always
torn and dirty, but even she switched herself around
a good deal; couldn’t help it, being a girl, Jerry
supposed. And once she had stopped in front of
Jerry’s house to pat Mutt with a grimy, affectionate
paw.</p>

<p>Well, Jerry wrote his letter. He knew precisely
what he wanted. So he told Santa Claus all about it,
told him about the dragons and pirates and lions and
soldiers he wanted in the book, mentioned the blue
cover, explained the size, called Santa’s attention
to his record as a good boy all year, and stated that
there must be no girls in the book. Then he went
over the letter, scattering commas and periods
lavishly in every sentence, and signed his name,
Jerry Juddikins, 123 Whippoorwill Road. As Jerry
watched it go up the chimney, he felt a tug at his
heart he had never quite felt before; he would get his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
precious book on Christmas morning; Santa Claus
would see to that.</p>

<p>Benjamin Bookfellow came into his workshop the
next morning rubbing his hands and telling himself
what a really fine job he had in the world, anyway.
To live in the North Country with Santa Claus and
Mrs. Claus and all the toymakers, to write books all
year long for children’s Christmas stockings—what
could be finer than that, asked Benjamin Bookfellow
of himself. Most of all, he thought, he liked this cozy
room of his where the sun shone in so gayly and the
Plot Tree, thick with plots for stories, reared its
beautiful branches over his head. Benjamin Bookfellow
was very happy that morning as he settled
down to Page Twenty-four of “Chief Thunder-cloud’s
Revenge,” a book he was writing for a little
tomboy of a girl, named Katinka, who liked Indian
stories almost as much as she liked lollipops, which
was saying a good deal.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Hickety-Stickety came in. Hickety-Stickety
was the postmaster of the Claus establishment.
He had a letter in his hand and he looked worried.</p>

<p>“Santy Claus sent ye this here,” he began. “It’s
from a boy as goes to Peppermint Place school. He
wants a queer thing, he do. He wants a book as
hasn’t got no girls in it.”</p>

<p>Benjamin Bookfellow reached out for the letter.
“Pyrits,” it said, “soldieres, draggens”; all that
was easy. “no, girls, in it Santa Claus not; one.” A
book without girls in it? Benjamin Bookfellow had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
never heard of such a thing. Girls were absolutely
necessary to books. Dragons had to eat them, knights
had to rescue them; how could you possibly have a
book without a girl in it?</p>

<p>And yet maybe the Plot Tree would have that
kind of story on it after all. Benjamin reached up
and picked off a luscious fruit. He opened it carefully
and out fell the plot, a little round ball with
words written all over it. He read it hastily. No,
here was a girl right off, a girl and a gnome and a
prince, quite obviously a fairy story.</p>

<p>He pulled down another plot, then more plots and
more plots and more plots, cut them open and took
out the round ball and still not a single story without
a girl in it, just as he had feared. Poor Benjamin
Bookfellow! His face was as long as your arm.</p>

<p>At supper that night in Santa Claus’ dining room,
when Benjamin and Hickety-Stickety and the
Twelve Toymakers were all at table with the
Clauses, Santa Claus said first thing: “Well, Bookfellow,
and did you find a story without a girl in it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t, sir,” replied Benjamin sadly. “I took
off every single plot from the tree, and they all had
girls in them.”</p>

<p>Santa Claus’ rosy chops fell. “Have you called in
the Authors, Bookfellow?” Santa Claus wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Benjamin Bookfellow knew what was coming. The
Authors sometimes wrote books to help Benjamin
when he got crowded with work.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I haven’t yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“Then do send for them immediately,” said Santa
Claus. “We must get Jerry Juddikins’ book, you
know, at any cost.”</p>

<p>The next morning Santa Claus sent the reindeer
down to the edge of the North Country to meet the
Authors, while Benjamin Bookfellow fidgeted and
fussed around his study.</p>

<p>At last they came, a whole sleighful—stylish authors,
down-at-the-heel authors, shy authors, important
authors, authors with fur overcoats, authors
with no overcoats, lady authors twittering, authors,
authors, authors. But the interview was short. Not
a single author could even imagine a book without
a girl in it, much less produce one.</p>

<p>“I give it up,” said Benjamin Bookfellow. “Jerry
Juddikins will just have to take a regular book, a
book with girls in it, and try to be contented with
it.”</p>

<p>So he set to work on all the other books he had to
finish before Christmas.</p>

<p>Whereupon he discovered, to his horror and dismay,
that there wasn’t a plot in the place. He had
plucked them yesterday and laid them on his work
table, and now they were gone, every single one of
them, gone. Benjamin Bookfellow, in great agitation,
looked high and low for his plots, in every corner
and crevice. He moved the furniture and looked behind
the pictures.</p>

<p>And then Benjamin Bookfellow knew the worst.
The Authors had stolen his plots, and now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
couldn’t write his Christmas books. With a groan
Benjamin Bookfellow sank in his chair.</p>

<p>Great was the sorrow of jolly old Santa Claus and
great was the sorrow of Mrs. Claus and the Twelve
Toymakers when they learned the dreadful news.
No Christmas books for children! What a terrible
thing!</p>

<p>Well, there they were, Santa Claus and all his
helpers, with Christmas not two weeks off, and no
books for children’s stockings. Oh, there were some
books of course. Benjamin Bookfellow had been writing
books all year long, but there was no book for
Katinka, for hers was only half finished; and there
was no book for Jerry Juddikins, who didn’t want
anything but a book for Christmas.</p>

<p>Santa Claus thought maybe the Plot Tree would
grow some new plots for the rest of the books, but
Benjamin Bookfellow said no. There were some buds
on the trees, but you can’t expect buds to be fruit in
a week.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if you watered it an extra lot the plots
would grow,” said Santa Claus at dinner next day.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if you pruned it—” began Toymaker
Number Five, but that was no good either; the Plot
Tree had been beautifully pruned just a few weeks
before and now was a marvel of perfect branches and
healthy sap.</p>

<p>“Did you ever try using a little imagination on
it?” asked Toymaker Number Eleven timidly. Everybody
stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“What’s imagination?” asked Hickety-Stickety.</p>

<p>“Why—” commenced Santa Claus and stopped.</p>

<p>“Why—” began Mrs. Claus and stopped.</p>

<p>“Why—” Benjamin Bookfellow started and
stopped.</p>

<p>So Toymaker Number Eleven finished up for
them.</p>

<p>“Why, Hickety-Stickety,” he said in a little thin
voice, “if you think up a lovely story that never
happened, but is better than anything that ever did
happen, that’s imagination. There’s a spring,” he
added dreamily, “where the waters of imagination
grow. I know where that spring is.”</p>

<p>“You do?” everybody at the table cried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Toymaker Number Eleven, still
in the same musing voice. “It’s in the deep woods
down between green banks. Even in winter the banks
are green; the snow melts when it touches them. A
hawthorn tree almost hides the spring from view,
but at night when the moon is shining you can see
the water quite plainly; it’s silver and black and it
sings a little song.”</p>

<p>“Well,” boomed Santa Claus in a big voice, “that
solves the whole thing. To-night we’ll get some of
that wonderful water, and sprinkle it on the Plot
Tree and then it will burst forth with plots and
Bookfellow can write his books.”</p>

<p>Which is just what happened. When the moon
came up that night Benjamin Bookfellow, led by
Toymaker Number Eleven, went in the deep woods
down to the green banks behind the hawthorn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
scooped up a pailful of the wonderful water and took
it back to the Plot Tree. At the first sprinkle the buds
began to flower; at the next sprinkle the flowers
bloomed into green fruit; at the last sprinkle the
green fruit turned yellow like oranges and seemed
ready to burst. Three sprinkles, and the buds were
full-grown plots, ready to be nipped off by Benjamin
Bookfellow and used for children’s books. A wonderful
thing, imagination. Nobody ever need scoff at it
again.</p>

<p>But still Jerry Juddikins’ book was not forthcoming,
for even the new plots all had girls in them.
Jerry didn’t know he wouldn’t get his book of
course. He didn’t dream that in all the store of
Santa’s treasures there wouldn’t be a book without a
girl in it. So he was very happy.</p>

<p>It was in the evening of two days before Christmas,
and already the air of Christmas was abroad.
The air crackled with Christmas, the windows of people’s
houses flaunted Christmas, the snow crunched
with Christmas in every crunch, and everywhere
there was that tingling feel of Christmas. Even Mutt
had Christmas in his bones and had gone off on an
adventure, tail up, nose up, barking with Christmas
joy. And then to cap the climax, Mr. Juddikins came
home with a job in his pocket! Oh, such joy in the
Juddikins’ house! They were all quite delirious
with it.</p>

<p>They wished Mutt would come back though. They
knew how happy he would be when they told him.
Mr. Juddikins hurried out and bought a fat bone for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
him, such a bone as Mutt had dreamed of all his
life but had never yet set teeth upon. They unbolted
the door, the more quickly to open it when Mutt came
back. Then they sat down and waited, the bone on a
plate, the door unlatched.</p>

<p>But Mutt did not come back. Six o’clock came, and
half-past six and seven. Eight o’clock came, and half-past
eight and nine. The Juddikins went out into the
snow-covered garden calling, “Mutt, Mutt, Mutt.”
They went up and down Whippoorwill Road hunting
and calling and searching. But he was gone and they
sat around the fire, Mr. Juddikins and Mrs. Juddikins
and Jerry, with terror and ache in their
hearts. Even the baby looked sad as she slept in her
high chair.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, as they sat there, they heard
steps up the walk; not dog steps but human steps,
a big, long stride like a man’s and a little short
hippety-hop like a girl’s. A knock came at the door,
a big rap from a man’s hand, a little tattoo from a
girl’s hand. Mr. Juddikins looked fearfully at Mrs.
Juddikins, and Jerry looked at them both. Here was
somebody to tell them Mutt was dead. They couldn’t
move.</p>

<p>The knock came again.</p>

<p>“Go,” said Mrs. Juddikins to Mr. Juddikins.</p>

<p>Mr. Juddikins went, and in tumbled a bundle of
red curls, sticky lips, smeared hands, torn coat. It
was Katinka. At her heels followed a tall black overcoat
with a kind face; Katinka’s father.</p>

<p>“He’s all right, Jerry!” cried Katinka falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
into the room. “Mutt’s all right! He’s just a little
hurt, and he’s asleep now by our fire. I wrapped his
leg up and gave him an enormous supper.”</p>

<p>Katinka’s father spoke next, smiling kindly.
“Your dog had a little accident, Mr. Juddikins,” he
said.</p>

<p>Accident! Jerry turned white, and Katinka struck
in again. “But he’s quite all right, Jerry. He gave
me the sweetest looks when I was fixing his leg, and
we’ll bring him home in the morning.”</p>

<p>Then Katinka’s father explained to the anxious
and bewildered Juddikins what had happened. “It
was about seven o’clock,” he said, “and the butcher
boy was hurrying his horse down the road, to get
home to his supper, I suppose. We heard the horse;
he was going like lightning. Katinka was in the yard,
and the next thing my wife and I knew was a noise
in the road. Katinka was screaming, a dog was yelping.
It was your dog, Mr. Juddikins. He had run in
front of the cart, and Katinka had run in front of
it, too, and had snatched the dog from the horses’
feet.” He looked at Katinka with the proudest eyes.
“She really saved him from being killed, I think.”</p>

<p>Katinka had saved Mutt from being killed! That
little girl with her sticky hands had run right under
the horses’ hoofs and brought their Mutt to safety.
The Juddikins couldn’t speak. Their hearts seemed
to choke into their very mouths, but they looked at
her as if she were something holy.</p>

<p>Katinka started for the door. “It’s all right now,”
she said. “I wanted you to know. Oh, he’s a darling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
dog, Jerry. And his leg is only cut a little because I
had to throw him, and he hit the curb.”</p>

<p>“And weren’t you hurt?” asked Mr. Juddikins,
the first word any of them had spoken.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, no. I never get hurt,” answered Katinka
loftily, and made for the door.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The next morning Santa Claus received the most
surprising letter. He thought it was too late for
Christmas letters, but here came one on this very
day before Christmas. It was from Jerry Juddikins,
and it was written in the wildest haste. You could
tell that by the handwriting. It said: <i>Dear Santa
Claus: I, love girls now, please, please. put a girl
just like Katinka in my book,.</i></p>

<p>So Benjamin Bookfellow wrote all morning and
all afternoon, a beautiful blue book with pirates and
dragons and soldiers in it and a heroine who was
just like Katinka, and that night Santa Claus took it
to Whippoorwill Road and put it in Jerry’s stocking.</p>

<p>And every day after that Jerry carried his
precious book under his arm, and every night he
slept with it under his pillow, and he was the happiest
boy in the whole world and Katinka was his
best friend.</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>George Madden Martin</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spread of the spruce-tree at its base, where its
branches rested on the snow in the bishop’s yard,
was thirty feet. The apex, to which the branches
mounted in slanting tiers, was fifty feet above the
ground.</p>

<p>The December afternoon was cold—not much
above zero. Weather of that kind was most unusual
in a region so far south. The sky was gray. Now
and then a few big snow-flakes came silently down
to join the white brotherhood that had already
fallen a foot deep on the level and more than two
feet deep in the drifts.</p>

<p>The shrubs about the yard looked like snow hillocks;
the round bushes were cone-shaped, the
branching ones were wreathed. Not a berry or seed-vessel
or grass-spear or weed-tuft was anywhere
visible.</p>

<p>In these bleak surroundings, a valiant and energetic
gentleman in the scarlet cassock and biretta of
a cardinal—a cardinal with wings and beak and
feathers, you understand—was darting from point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
to point of the big evergreen, from apex to branch,
from branch to apex, a gorgeous splash of color
against the clear green of the boughs and the blue-white
of the snow.</p>

<p>The spruce, with the flitting cardinal on its boughs,
stood at the side of the bishop’s grounds between his
slate-roofed and ivy-clad house and the brick orphan
asylum.</p>

<p>The bishop’s bedroom was on the same side of the
house as the spruce, and just now the bachelor bishop
himself was at a window of the square bay of this
chamber, looking out upon his grounds and the big
evergreen in the bleak and wintry setting. He was
just becoming acquainted with the spruce and his
side yard.</p>

<p>The robe that he wore at the moment had less of
the episcopal dignity than that of the cardinal in the
evergreen; the bishop’s was a gray-and-black dressing-gown,
and it was tied about his body with a
gray-and-black cord and tassels.</p>

<p>His expression, or what could be seen of it,—for
this square-featured, clean-shaven bishop wore a
green celluloid shade over his eyes,—was rueful. It
was the first Christmas after his arrival from a distant
state to be head of this Southern diocese. And
behold, three weeks after his coming, here he was—ill
with the measles!</p>

<p>He was in his venerable predecessor’s house, and
that was why the stately spruce and the cardinal
were new to him.</p>

<p>The dwelling, in its old grounds, with a small,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
slate-roofed church to the left of it and the asylum
to the right of it, stood on the car-line a little way
out from the chief city of the diocese. The wife of
the late bishop had owned it long before trolley-cars
were dreamed of; had built the church and the
asylum, and given them to her husband’s diocese;
had died, and left the dwelling to her husband.
When, within a year, he followed her, he had left
the place as an episcopal residence for his successors.</p>

<p>The old bishop’s pensioned servants remained, integral
parts of the institution. Neither a new broom
nor a new bishop must sweep too clean. Even one
who has authority, when he finds himself among the
old associations and traditions and institutions of a
sedate community, must move slowly.</p>

<p>The bishop found the household of which he was
bachelor proprietor somewhat dreary. There was
old Mrs. Dyer, the housekeeper, a distant relative of
the old bishop’s, gold-spectacled, tall and spare.
There was old Aunty Sally, the colored cook, silver-spectacled,
short and fat. There was Thomas, the
colored coachman and gardener, gray-haired, and,
for the time, confined to his room over the tool-house
by rheumatism. There was old white Tim, the general
factotum and furnace-tender of the asylum, the
rectory and the church; he had gone to town that
morning for his Christmas purchases, and so far, at
four o’clock in the afternoon, had not returned. In
this venerable company the new bishop felt a mere
infant in arms, an infant with measles!—the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
so, because from the beginning he had refused to
have a trained nurse, and had put himself into the
hands of Mrs. Dyer and Aunt Sally.</p>

<p>The house overflowed with flowers and delicacies
that his good people, few of whom he yet knew, had
sent him. But to-day as he stood at his window and
gazed out on the winter scene he was feeling lonely
and a little aggrieved. No doubt it was the bleakness
of the day and the nearness of the Christmas season
under the present conditions of captivity, that depressed
him.</p>

<p>In a direct line across from him, at no great distance,
stood the asylum; its side windows looked on
his own, and both sets of windows looked upon the
spruce-tree. As he had barely established himself
in his present residence when he took the measles, he
had had no chance to become acquainted with the
asylum, or its affairs, or its inmates.</p>

<p>Had that little red-feathered fellow out there on
the snow-clad evergreen-tree gone crazy? The bishop
came from the city, and knew neither the spruce nor
the cardinal by name. The cardinal was dipping and
rising about the tree, fluttering and darting, now
here, now there, from branch to twig, from twig to
branch.</p>

<p>“And always as if he had his red-ringed small
eye on the gallery,” said the bishop, who meant by
“gallery,” himself at the window.</p>

<p>Just then the cardinal left the big spruce-tree altogether,
and dropped to the snow-mantled clump
of spirea nearer the house. Immediately there appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
upon the branches of the spruce two flashing,
swaggering, top-knotted blue jays.</p>

<p>The cardinal flew from the spirea; down from the
spruce dropped the jays to the bush that he had left;
and almost at once two brown and speckled sapsuckers
perched upon the branches of the evergreen.</p>

<p>The bishop looked on with interest. Almost
parrot-like the cardinal was clinging with the coral-red
claws of his coral-red legs to the sharp edge of
the window-sill; his red head and coral beak were
held sidewise, and his beady eyes were upturned
sharply. Behind him was a world that was cold and
desolate and threatening. The white flakes were falling
persistently.</p>

<p>Then the bell of the bishop’s telephone rang. The
doctor who twice a day came in to see him and cheer
him up had forbidden him to use his eyes or to do
any hard work or to see his secretary, who had not
had the measles; but he could use his ears and his
tongue. So he had had the telephone brought into his
room and set upon a table, and he talked daily with
his dean at the cathedral in town, with various members
of his clergy, and with other official persons.</p>

<p>He turned from the window at the ring, and lifted
the receiver.</p>

<p>“Bishop Herbert at the telephone. Yes?” said
he, and his voice was deep and genial and sonorous.</p>

<p>“He is telling you that he is hungry, please,” said
a voice, small and anxious.</p>

<p>“Who is hungry? Who is this speaking?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“The cardinal-bird on your window-sill. This is
Gwinie.”</p>

<p>“Why should he be telling me? And who is
Gwinie? And how does she know a cardinal-bird is
on my window-sill and hungry?”</p>

<p>“I can see him there. I live across from you at
the asylum. He is hungry because I can’t come over
and put crumbs on his bird-tray; and it’s snowed
three days now.”</p>

<p>“Where is his bird-tray? And why can’t you
come?”</p>

<p>“It’s there by the spruce-tree. You can see it from
your window. It’s a tray on a stake in the ground.
The other bishop kept it full. I can’t come over and
fill it the way I’ve been doing because I’ve got the
measles.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said the bishop. “So have I. Is there
anybody over there who can come and fill it? You
cannot expect me to ask Mrs. Dyer to wade out there
in a blizzard. And old Aunt Sally would go under
in the drifts.”</p>

<p>“The doctor told us you had measles,” said
Gwinie. “You took them first; then we did. He’s just
gone. He said I might come to the telephone and call
up, and tell whoever answered about the cardinal.
He said he didn’t want to have my measles worried
in. We’ve all got them. There isn’t anybody who can
come. Tim, he’s never got home from town. We’ve
put crumbs out, but the birds don’t know it, and the
snow keeps covering the crumbs up. We haven’t any
tray over here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“H’m!” said the bishop. “And how can I put
crumbs on the sills of French windows? They open
outward, you know. What? Hold on there, Gwinie!”</p>

<p>“I have to go. Miss Lowry, she’s called three
times. But I’ll think.”</p>

<p>The bishop hung up his receiver, and returned to
the window to survey the situation in the light of
what he had just learned. The cardinal had advanced
boldly on the sill, and now hopped back and forth on
it, with his bright eye fixed on the occupant of the
room.</p>

<p>The jays and sapsuckers were on the spirea together,
and a dozen small, crested birds with brown
backs and slate-colored breasts were flitting anxiously
about the spruce-tree. Across the open space,
at an asylum window, was a little girl, flattening her
nose against the pane. She was wrapped in a heavy
blanket, and she wore a shade!</p>

<p>Was it Gwinie? She saw him. The flattened nose
drew back, and its owner waved a hand. It <i>was</i>
Gwinie. Suddenly she turned, as if something had
compelled her attention in the room behind her. And
then she disappeared. The bishop felt a pang of loneliness.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed while he wondered what he
could do. He put the question to the cardinal himself
on the sill: How could either of them ask fat little
old Aunt Sally to wade out through the big drifts to
that tray? Then the telephone rang again.</p>

<p>“It’s Gwinie. Miss Lowry says I may speak one
minute. It’s about Mr. Blythe. He takes the orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
from the asylum for Santy Claus every year. We tell
him what we want most, and he puts it down, and we
get it. This year the doctor had to take the orders
for him because of the measles. So I asked the doctor
to-day, if he saw Mr. Blythe, to get him to ask Santy
to see to the birds till I get over the measles. And
Mr. Blythe just called up to say he will telephone
Santy direct, himself, about tending to them.”</p>

<p>It is to be presumed that when “Santy” received
the message, he acted promptly. No doubt he knew
as well as Gwinie did—although the bishop did not
know—that even in the South a starving cardinal
compelled to endure the rigors of a night with the
thermometer at zero would be a little scarlet corpse
on the snow by morning. Before the early dusk quite
closed in, the grocer’s delivery boy appeared in the
bishop’s side yard. He took off his cap to the dignitary
at the window, tramped knee-deep out to the
bird-tray, and emptied his pockets and the contents
of a paper bag on the tray. Then he lifted his cap
again to the figure at the window, and departed.</p>

<p>The door of the bishop’s room opened, and Mrs.
Dyer appeared, followed by Aunt Sally, who bore
the patient’s supper. The women stirred the open
fire, brushed the hearth, drew the curtains, and
lighted the lamp. They pulled the table up near the
blaze, laid the white cloth upon it, and arranged the
contents of the tray.</p>

<p>“Creamed oysters, beefsteak, rolls, waffles, coffee,
quince preserves? Good gracious, Mrs. Dyer, do
I, a patient, dare to eat all that? Very well, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
since my friend the cardinal has his supper also, outside.
But you do not know about that. And, one moment,
Mrs. Dyer, before you and Aunt Sally go; who
is Mr. Blythe?”</p>

<p>“He goes by heah ev’y mornin’ to the trolley.
He’s one o’ those heah pink-colored young men,”
said Aunt Sally.</p>

<p>“He’s a general favorite,” said Mrs. Dyer. “He
lives with an aunt up on the hill.”</p>

<p>“He sells money at one o’ these heah banks. The
bishop he bought his’n f’om him. Got it ev’y Sat’day
reg’lar foh to pay us’en off all roun’.”</p>

<p>“He thinks a great deal of Christmas,” said Mrs.
Dyer. “I hear he is as disappointed as the children
at the asylum that there will be no tree this year
because of the measles.”</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Blythe’s fortunate telephone connection,
Santa Claus continued his useful work.
When the bishop got up the next day—none too
early, to be sure—more snow had fallen, but the
tray was swept clean of it and heaped with a fresh
meal; and the birds had gathered round in dozens.
Moreover, on the spruce-tree above the tray hung a
placard; it was white, with large black letters, and
it was visible to both sets of windows that looked
upon the yard:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To His Grace The Cardinal, And Other Tenants. Please
Take Notice. This Tree is Preëmpted For The Christmas
Season.</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">S. Claus.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The cold weather held; that evening the grocer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
boy appeared again, and once more emptied his
pockets and a paper bag on the birds’ tray. And the
next morning Santy or one of his emissaries had
again swept the tray and refilled it. On the snow-draped
and trailing spruce hung a second placard.
It was more elaborately printed than the first one
had been, and touches of holiday scarlet relieved the
black of its letters.</p>

<p>In the asylum, a dozen small faces now appeared
at the windows where one small child had flattened
her nose against the pane two days before. The children
were all wrapped in blankets, and wore green
shades over their eyes. This is what they read on the
placard:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To His Grace The Cardinal, And His Friends, Near
And Far. Please Take Notice. Gifts will be Ready for
Distribution from this Tree To-morrow, Christmas Day in
the Morning.</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">S. Claus.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The presents <i>were</i> ready for distribution when
that blessed morning dawned, snow-bound and cold
and still. There were many stories circulated as to
how and when the work had been done.</p>

<p>One story was that among the agents whom S.
Claus had found it necessary to call upon for aid in
the work were the grocer’s boy and Mr. Blythe.</p>

<p>Some persons said that it could not have been
done without the help of the hook and ladder from
the engine-house two miles away. Others were convinced
that unofficial ladders and orchard-pruning
implements had done it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>Whatever the truth of the matter is, the orphan
asylum certainly knew nothing about it, for that
was wrapped in measles, and could not have peeped.
As for the bishop, not for worlds would he have
done such a thing.</p>

<p>However, Mr. S. Claus and his friends did
achieve it, and when Christmas day dawned, clear
and crisp and cold, the bishop and the asylum and
Mrs. Dyer and Aunt Sally gazed out upon a transformed
spruce-tree.</p>

<p>Everything was on it that should be on a tree
for hungry birds—and more. For besides cranberries
in strings, pop-corn in festoons, grain in
gold and scarlet cornucopias, ginger-bread men, red
apples, tallow candles, half loaves of bread, biscuits,
there were many things that were there not to be
eaten, but to make a glitter.</p>

<p>His grace the cardinal, a scarlet splash against
the winter blue sky, was poised upon the very topmost
black tip of the glorious old evergreen. And
not only the two jays, but a dozen other handsome
and noisy jays, as well as the speckled sapsuckers
and many smaller birds, hung in mid-air about the
branches, rapt and almost motionless. As the vested
choir from the choir-room that adjoined the asylum
crossed the yard through the brick cloister for the
seven-o’clock service at the little church, they sang
with hearty voices:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O morning stars, together</div>
    <div class="verse indent1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>Proclaim the holy birth!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And praises sing to God, the King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And peace to men on earth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The bishop and Gwinie and the many little children
of the asylum, all warmly wrapped in big
blankets, gazed out on the scene through their frosty
windows; and among those marching in the choir
through the cloister were Mr. Blythe and the
grocer’s boy, robed and beaming, and singing most
heartily of all.</p>

<p class="c large sp">A German legend for Christmas Eve as told by<br>
<i>Elizabeth Harrison</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, a long, long time ago, on the night
before Christmas, a little child was wandering all
alone through the streets of a great city. There were
many people on the street, fathers and mothers,
sisters and brothers, uncles and aunts, and even
gray-haired grandfathers and grandmothers, all of
whom were hurrying home with bundles of presents
for each other and for their little ones. Fine carriages
rolled by, express wagons rattled past, even
old carts were pressed into service, and all things
seemed in a hurry and glad with expectation of the
coming Christmas morning.</p>

<p>From some of the windows bright lights were
already beginning to stream until it was almost as
bright as day. But the little child seemed to have no
home, and wandered about listlessly from street
to street. No one took any notice of him except perhaps
Jack Frost, who bit his bare toes and made the
ends of his fingers tingle. The north wind, too,
seemed to notice the child, for it blew against him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
and pierced his ragged garments through and
through, causing him to shiver with cold. Home after
home he passed, looking with longing eyes through
the windows, in upon the glad, happy children, most
of whom were helping to trim the Christmas trees
for the coming morrow.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the child to himself, “where there
is so much gladness and happiness, some of it may
be for me.” So with timid steps he approached a
large and handsome house. Through the windows,
he could see a tall and stately Christmas tree
already lighted. Many presents hung upon it. Its
green boughs were trimmed with gold and silver
ornaments. Slowly he climbed up the broad steps
and gently rapped at the door. It was opened by a
large man-servant. He had a kindly face, although
his voice was deep and gruff. He looked at the little
child for a moment, then sadly shook his head and
said, “Go down off the steps. There is no room here
for such as you.” He looked sorry as he spoke; possibly
he remembered his own little ones at home, and
was glad that they were not out in this cold and
bitter night. Through the open door a bright light
shone, and the warm air, filled with fragrance of the
Christmas pine, rushed out from the inner room and
greeted the little wanderer with a kiss. As the child
turned back into the cold and darkness, he wondered
why the footman had spoken thus, for surely,
thought he, those little children would love to have
another companion join them in their joyous Christmas
festival. But the little children inside did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
not even know that he had knocked at the door.</p>

<p>The street grew colder and darker as the child
passed on. He went sadly forward, saying to himself,
“Is there no one in all this great city who will
share the Christmas with me?” Farther and farther
down the street he wandered, to where the homes
were not so large and beautiful. There seemed to be
little children inside of nearly all the houses. They
were dancing and frolicking about. Christmas trees
could be seen in nearly every window, with beautiful
dolls and trumpets and picture-books and balls and
tops and other dainty toys hung upon them. In one
window the child noticed a little lamb made of soft
white wool. Around its neck was tied a red ribbon.
It had evidently been hung on the tree for one of
the children. The little stranger stopped before this
window and looked long and earnestly at the beautiful
things inside, but most of all was he drawn
toward the white lamb. At last creeping up to the
window-pane, he gently tapped upon it. A little girl
came to the window and looked out into the dark
street where the snow had begun to fall. She saw the
child, but she only frowned and shook her head and
said, “Go away and come some other time. We are
too busy to take care of you now.” Back into the
dark, cold streets he turned again. The wind was
whirling past him and seemed to say, “Hurry on,
hurry on, we have no time to stop. ’Tis Christmas
Eve and everybody is in a hurry to-night.”</p>

<p>Again and again the little child rapped softly at
door or window-pane. At each place he was refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
admission. One mother feared he might have some
ugly disease which her darlings would catch; another
father said he had only enough for his own
children and none to spare for beggars. Still another
told him to go home where he belonged, and not to
trouble other folks.</p>

<p>The hours passed; later grew the night, and
colder grew the wind, and darker seemed the street.
Farther and farther the little one wandered. There
was scarcely any one left upon the street by this
time, and the few who remained did not seem to see
the child, when suddenly ahead of him there appeared
a bright, single ray of light. It shone through
the darkness into the child’s eyes. He looked up smilingly
and said, “I will go where the small light
beckons, perhaps they will share their Christmas
with me.”</p>

<p>Hurrying past all the other houses, he soon
reached the end of the street and went straight up to
the window from which the light was streaming. It
was a poor, little, low house, but the child cared not
for that. The light seemed still to call him in. From
what do you suppose the light came? Nothing but a
tallow candle which had been placed in an old cup
with a broken handle, in the window, as a glad token
of Christmas Eve. There was neither curtain nor
shade to the small, square window and as the little
child looked in he saw standing upon a neat wooden
table a branch of a Christmas tree. The room was
plainly furnished but it was very clean. Near the
fireplace sat a lovely faced mother with a little two-year-old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
on her knee and an older child beside her.
The two children were looking into their mother’s
face and listening to a story. She must have been
telling them a Christmas story, I think. A few bright
coals were burning in the fireplace, and all seemed
light and warm within.</p>

<p>The little wanderer crept closer and closer to the
window-pane. So sweet was the mother’s face, so
loving seemed the little children, that at last he took
courage and tapped gently, very gently on the door.
The mother stopped talking, the little children
looked up. “What was that, mother?” asked the
little girl at her side. “I think it was some one tapping
on the door,” replied the mother. “Run as
quickly as you can and open it, dear, for it is a
bitter cold night to keep any one waiting in this
storm.” “Oh, mother, I think it was the bough of the
tree tapping against the window-pane,” said the
little girl. “Do please go on with our story.” Again
the little wanderer tapped upon the door. “My child,
my child,” exclaimed the mother, rising, “that certainly
was a rap on the door. Run quickly and open
it. No one must be left out in the cold on our beautiful
Christmas Eve.”</p>

<p>The child ran to the door and threw it wide open.
The mother saw the ragged stranger standing without,
cold and shivering, with bare head and almost
bare feet. She held out both hands and drew him into
the warm, bright room. “You poor, dear child,” was
all she said, and putting her arms around him, she
drew him close to her breast. “He is very cold, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
children,” she exclaimed. “We must warm him.”
“And,” added the little girl, “we must love him and
give him some of our Christmas, too.” “Yes,” said
the mother, “but first let us warm him.”</p>

<p>The mother sat down by the fire with the little
child on her lap, and her own little one warmed his
half-frozen hands in theirs. The mother smoothed
his tangled curls, and, bending low over his head,
kissed the child’s face. She gathered the three little
ones in her arms and the candle and the fire light
shone over them. For a moment the room was very
still. By and by the little girl said softly, to her
mother, “May we not light the Christmas tree, and
let him see how beautiful it looks?” “Yes,” said the
mother. With that she seated the child on a low stool
beside the fire, and went herself to fetch the few
simple ornaments which from year to year she had
saved for her children’s Christmas tree. They were
soon so busy that they did not notice the room had
filled with a strange and brilliant light. They turned
and looked at the spot where the little wanderer sat.
His ragged clothes had changed to garments white
and beautiful; his tangled curls seemed like a halo
of golden light about his head; but most glorious of
all was his face, which shone with a light so dazzling
that they could scarcely look upon it.</p>

<p>In silent wonder they gazed at the child. Their
little room seemed to grow larger and larger, until it
was as wide as the whole world, the roof of their
low house seemed to expand and rise, until it
reached the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>With a sweet and gentle smile the wonderful child
looked upon them for a moment, and then slowly
rose and floated through the air, above the tree-tops,
beyond the church spire, higher even than the clouds
themselves, until he appeared to them to be a shining
star in the sky above. At last he disappeared
from sight. The astonished children turned in
hushed awe to their mother, and said in a whisper,
“Oh, mother, it was the Christ-Child, was it not?”
And the mother answered in a low tone, “Yes.”</p>

<p>And it is said, dear children, that each Christmas
Eve the little Christ-Child wanders through some
town or village, and those who receive him and take
him into their homes and hearts have given to them
this marvellous vision which is denied to others.</p>

</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Thomas Travis</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were three of them, plodding wearily through
the snow, a man, a woman, and a boy about six years
old. The man and the woman seemed gloomy, sad,
and walked along silently till, with a deep sigh, the
man spoke: “It’s too bad, too bad, Mother, the storm
coming up like this. If it had only held off a couple of
hours more, we’d have made town all right. But as it
is—well, what’ll we do?” And he looked wearily at
the snow-covered mountains and the trackless waste
of snow. He shivered as his cold face brushed a laden
bush that dabbed his bare neck with icy snow. “It’s
bitter cold, isn’t it, Mother? And if I’m not mistaken,
the storm’s only just beginning.”</p>

<p>The mother was too tired to answer. They had
walked this way all day.</p>

<p>“If it had only held off a couple of hours,” the
man repeated gloomily, “we’d have made the town
all right. And there’s a job for me there. We’d have
had a good Christmas, after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, Daddy,” said little Sandy, sturdily,
“maybe the storm’ll stop soon and somebody come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
along and give us a ride. Wouldn’t it be fun if we
could have a real sleigh-ride—at Christmas?”</p>

<p>But nobody came along the bleak waste, as they
still plodded on. And the storm did not stop. It blew
up stronger and stronger before a bitter northeast
wind that sent whirling clouds of icy snow against
their faces and sifted it down their necks, till they
were wet and half frozen. It was only about four in
the afternoon; but the wind had now risen to a howling
storm that made the great trees rock and groan
and scream in answer to the snoring of the white
gale, and forced the three to bend almost double to
force their way against it.</p>

<p>They were all three tired, miserably tired, and
hungry and cold. The snow-laden swirls covered
them till they looked like walking ghosts. Little
Sandy’s feet ached dreadfully; but he was a sturdy
lad, and as he walked, he kept chattering out all sorts
of questions, just to keep his mind off his cold feet.
He didn’t care whether his questions were answered
or not—he just talked.</p>

<p>A big crow came swirling down the gale, veered
in the shelter of a clump of pines, set his black wings,
and, with a doleful caw, settled on one of the lower
branches. Another did the same, and another, the
three crows snuggling up to each other with a soft
chuckle that said, just as plain as plain could be:
“Boy, but it’s cold! And it’s going to be a cold night
for old Jim Crow. Better be looking up a bed now,
before it gets too dark. It’s a hummer, this gale is, a
hummer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>And the father felt just about the same. “We’d
better look for some sort of a shelter, Mother,” he
said; “we can’t make town to-night. We’ll be frozen
stiff. Just my luck! Out of work since Thanksgiving;
get a letter that there’s a good job here for me if I
can make it by Christmas—and here’s this snow!”
And he peered through the blinding storm to where
the city lights showed once in a while deep down in
the valley.</p>

<p>“But look, Dad!” Sandy shouted; “look! There’s
just the place for us.” And he pointed down in a hollow,
where a little log-cabin lay pushed into a thick
clump of tall evergreens.</p>

<p>Snow was drifted over the roof and over the trail
to the door, as they entered and looked around. In
fact, it had no door, only the place for one. It had
two windows, but only one had glass in it. And it had
neither fireplace nor stove—only a square of logs
filled in with sand, for the fire, and a hole in the roof
to let the smoke out.</p>

<p>“Just my luck!” said the father; “just my luck!”
And he shivered again as the bitter wind swirled a
cloud of icy snow through the door and window.</p>

<p>But Sandy piped up: “Well, anyhow, it’s better
than nothing. And besides, I think it’s just fine. We
can camp here and be all right. Come on, let’s make
a warm fire.” For his feet ached now so badly he
could scarcely keep the tears back.</p>

<p>They hunted around, found an old lantern, and
lit it, for it was now dark. And the gale had helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
them somewhat, after all. For they found great dry
branches of the fragrant pine, broken off by the
wind, piled in heaps—some of it splintered to shreds
under the twisting of the gale.</p>

<p>Soon a roaring fire was going. But the wind, howling
through the doorway and the window, made it
pretty hard to get warm.</p>

<p>“Just my kind of luck!” grumbled the father.</p>

<p>But Sandy said: “Supposin’ we get some of those
little trees, those pine and spruce, and pack them in
the door and window. That will keep the wind out,
and make us snug as a bug in a rug. Come on.”</p>

<p>So they packed the window and the door with
spruce-trees broken off and stuck in the deep drift.
Father sighed a bit with satisfaction, and Mother
sat down with a weary smile, thrusting her hands
out to the blaze as she looked tenderly at the boy.</p>

<p>“Fine Christmas, isn’t it?” grunted the father,
again; “fine Christmas! Look at the icicles hanging
on that spruce. Look at the snow powdering the
tree, and that right in the room with us. Fine Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Sure it’s fine,” said Sandy, sturdily. “I think
it’s finer than a boughten tree. It’s a real Christmas
tree, and it’s got real icicles, not glass ones. And it’s
got real snow for powder. All we want is some birds
and stars and things on it, and there wouldn’t be a
better Christmas tree anywhere. Mother and Daddy,
you rest. I’ll go out here and get a good stack of
wood,—that’ll keep the fire going,—and then we’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
have something to eat and we’ll be fine.” So, stamping
his cold feet, he squeezed through the blocked
door and crept out under the great pines.</p>

<p>Now what with the dense evergreens and the log-cabin,
it was comparatively quiet and calm there under
the pines. And Sandy got his first glimpse of
how the wild creatures live through a storm. The
lower branches of the pines were crowded with
crows, jays, and other feathered waifs of the storm.
They were doing their best to keep warm, and having
a hard time of it in that bitter gale.</p>

<p>You know, these wild birds must sleep out in all
kinds of weather. You know, too, that most birds’
feet can cling to a bough even when they are asleep.
Also, you know that feather coats are warmer even
than fur. And these birds, huddled together for
shelter, picking out the thickest parts of the low
boughs, snuggled down in the roaring gale and
tucked their heads under their wings, crouching
down low so that their feather overcoats could cover
them from head to feet.</p>

<p>But perhaps you may not know that there is one
weak point about this feather overcoat. They can not
entirely cover up in it. There is just one spot at the
eye which they can not cover. That too, perhaps, is
to shield them. They keep one eye out, literally, for
the fox and the owl and the hawk. But on a bitter
night like this, there is another trouble. If it gets too
cold, that one spot, meant for a lookout, will freeze.
And often after a bitter winter gale you will find
crows and jays and snowbirds blinded by the cold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
They have changed positions, put one eye, and then
the other under, but been able to keep neither warm.
That one bit, exposed, acts just as if you were all
tucked in blankets, except one toe. You can keep
changing the toe, but in bitter weather, very bitter,
that toe will freeze. So with the birds that roost.
They have no nest; they do not crawl into some hole.
They roost in fear of their enemies, and sometimes
pay the terrible penalty for that one hole in their
feather blanket.</p>

<p>That’s why sometimes you hear a “thump” on
your window on a very cold winter night, and the
next morning, find a poor quail or grouse or jay or
crow cold, freezing, half-blind already. He had seen
the glow of your fire dimly and flown to it—for
safety.</p>

<p>And that was what was happening when Sandy
crept out to get more firewood. This was a record
blizzard—a bitter, freezing, zero night. And the
birds were doing their level best to keep their eyes
warm. They did not even notice Sandy as he crept
near and watched. Some meadow-larks and quail had
crouched under the snow-covered bushes at the foot
of the pines, and they were bunched together, all
heads out and all trying to keep their eyes from
freezing. Sandy saw it and felt sorry for them. He
was trying to keep his own feet from freezing, and
knew how it felt. But he could not help the birds.</p>

<p>He could see the glow of the fire through the
spruce-blocked door and window. It shone cheerily
through the one window with glass. And hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Sandy gathered some wood and came back inside.
Then they ate their supper, Sandy saving the crumbs
for the birds.</p>

<p>The blizzard grew worse and worse. The great
trees rocked and groaned and cracked till Sandy
thought they would break off short and tumble on
the shaking cabin. Some of them did split, with a
boom like thunder, and fell with a muffled thud in
the deep snow. Then came faint twitterings and dismayed
caws. The birds were having a hard time out
there.</p>

<p>There came a thud against the single pane, and
Sandy lifted the sash to take in two quail that had
flown against the glass in their attempt to come into
the warm room. But the crows were wiser than the
quail. They came farther down through the twigs and
roosted on the branches. They showed the others the
way to the warm room. Then came some snowbirds,
their black-and-white feathers all fluffed out with
frost; and meadow-larks, quail, and grouse, all perching
on the tree in the window; all grateful for the
warm refuge in that terrible blizzard. Even a couple
of rabbits came hopping through the open door and
crouched panting from the gale.</p>

<p>So Sandy and Father and Mother sat over the
fire, trying hard to keep warm. Mother was so tired
she soon fell asleep, her head resting on Sandy’s lap.
They sat late, very late—almost to midnight. And
then came a wonderful thing—the storm stopped almost
suddenly. The stars came out; the northern
lights began to glow and burn like melted opals, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
soft fires, all colors, in the sky. It was Christmas eve,
and the churchbells in the valley began to ring out
Christmas carols—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It came upon the midnight clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That glorious song of old.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Faintly the bells rang, faint and far across the
snow.</p>

<p>So Sandy did not hear the approach of anybody
till there came a hail at the door. Pulling away the
spruce that blocked it, Sandy was surprised to see
a great, burly man enter, with a sheep under one
arm and half a dozen panting after him.</p>

<p>“Saw your firelight, neighbor,” he said. “Just
out trying to save my sheep in the storm. Thought
I’d never make it. But here we are.” And shepherd
and sheep crowded into the room.</p>

<p>“Come right along,” said the father. “It’s a bitter
night. Seems as if the cold grew worse since the
wind dropped. Come on in and sit down by the fire.
Fine Christmas, eh?”</p>

<p>The man with the sheep sat down, throwing off his
pack and using it as a chair. Puffing and blowing,
pulling icicles from his beard, he rumbled: “Fine
Christmas, you say? Well now, I’m glad of a place
to be in out of the cold. This looks fine enough to
me. Thought I’d never make it.” And he continued
combing the ice from his beard and mustache. “Fine
Christmas when I thought it was going to be a case
of freeze and lose all the sheep, and then get them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
safe into a nice snug place like this. This is fine
Christmas luck!”</p>

<p>“Sure it’s fine,” laughed Sandy, whose feet were
now warm again. “And just look! If that isn’t the
finest Christmas tree any boy ever had.” And he
pointed to the tree in the window.</p>

<p>It really was wonderful. Back of the tree blazed a
big star, just as if it hung on the topmost twig.
Scores of others twinkled through the evergreen
boughs. The northern lights crackled and shone mysteriously;
and against the lit sky they could see the
birds crouching—crows, iridescent, jays, gaudy blue,
meadow-larks, with breasts dipped in gold, quail,
grouse, and snowbirds in lovely markings and shadings,
all perched on the tree, chuckling and crooning
as though come there specially to decorate it.
Great icicles hung down glittering in the low glow of
the fire; and over all, the powdered snow glittered
like diamonds.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine Christmas tree, and I’m going to hang
my stockings on it when I go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Much good it’ll do you, Sandy,” grinned his
father; “no Christmas, no Santa this time.” Then,
turning to the shepherd, he explained grumpily,
“Out of work; goin’ for a job; caught in this storm;
stony broke—at Christmas time.”</p>

<p>“Hard lines,” said the shepherd, soberly; “but
that’s a fine boy you have. Seems a bright youngster
and just as chipper as can be.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said Sandy, as he curled in his
blanket before the fire, “I’ve hung up my stockings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
Maybe good old Santa will remember me after all.”</p>

<p>He really didn’t expect anything, you know; but
still he was a cheery soul. And as he slept, he
dreamed—dreamed a big, strong, genial Santa came
and filled his stockings with the nicest things—dreamed,
and mumbled in his sleep, “Well, anyhow,
it’s a good Christmas, after all.”</p>

<p>But the others just slept—Father and Mother too
sad and tired even to dream, till they were roused in
the early dawn of Christmas by a wild yell from
Sandy. There he stood in his blanket, hauling out
gift after gift from his stockings, from the twigs of
the trees, and even some from beneath the tree.</p>

<p>He never knew how they got there. But Sandy’s
father told me that the shepherd had them all in his
pack, bringing them home for his own family Christmas
tree. But the storm that stopped Sandy’s father,
stopped him too. And seeing Sandy so sturdy and
brave in the cold and night, he thought he would
give the presents to him and then buy others, since
he couldn’t get home in time for Christmas eve.</p>

<p>But Sandy never knew how they came. His eyes
simply grew big and shining in his six-year-old
face. His squeals of joy rang through the cabin, till
even the sheep huddled together a little nervously
and watched him with shy eyes. The birds of the tree
chuckled and flew out into the new dawn of Christmas
day. The shepherd’s sleigh came along and gave
them all a lift to town. And Father got his new job!</p>

<p>As the party separated in town, the shepherd took
little Sandy in his big strong arms as the boy said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
“Well, we had a merry Christmas, didn’t we? I
think it was fine.”</p>

<p>And the shepherd gave him an extra hug as he answered:
“Sandy, you have the best Christmas gift
of all. A Merry Christmas comes from inside a man,
from his happy and live soul, from his brave spirit.
The boy that has a gift like that doesn’t need anything
else. He’ll have a Merry Christmas anywhere.”</p>

<p>Sandy didn’t entirely understand. He just shook
hands cheerily with the shepherd, waved an arm to
the sheep, now huddled cosily in the straw of the
sled, picked up his bundle, and walked on with a grin
of joy.</p>

<p>“And anyhow,” he said that night, as he heard
his father telling about the terrible Christmas eve
they had had, “anyhow, we had a real tree and real
birds and real stars and real snow powder and real
sheep and—a real shepherd! I think it was just the
finest Christmas tree any boy ever had.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c21">THE LITTLE FIR-TREE<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Carolyn Wells</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Longer</span> ago than you ever heard of, and farther away
than you ever dreamed, the great Tree-master went
out to make the trees.</p>

<p>Now the making of trees was a most important
matter, and the Tree-master put his whole mind to
it. He made all sorts of trees to use for building
houses and making things to furnish the houses.
Oak, maple, elm, ash, mahogany, rosewood, and
many more, as you well know.</p>

<p>Then he made all sorts of trees to bear food:
fruits, nuts, olives, and queer things like breadfruit
and cocoanuts.</p>

<p>And he made lovely trees just to look pretty. He
made dogwood, magnolia, horse-chestnut, and holly.</p>

<p>Then the Tree-master gave each tree its orders
about blooming blossoms and bearing fruit, and at
last the Tree-master thought his work was about
done, and he turned to go away.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, sir,” said an anxious little voice,
“aren’t you going to give me anything nice to do?”</p>

<p>“Who is speaking?” growled the Tree-master, in
a voice of thunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“It’s only I,” and a very trembly tone reached
his ear. “I’m a little fir-tree, and I’m neither beautiful
nor useful.”</p>

<p>“You’re good enough,” said the Tree-master, as
he glanced at the poor little thing. “Behave yourself,
and no one will notice you.”</p>

<p>But they did notice her. The springtime came, and
all the fruit-trees put on their beautiful blossom-frocks,
and they jeered at the forlorn little fir-tree.</p>

<p>“Ho!” said the apple-tree, “look at my pink and
white garb. Is it not exquisite? Don’t you wish you
could be dressed like this?”</p>

<p>The poor little fir-tree looked on with longing
eyes, but she was too crushed to reply.</p>

<p>“And see mine!” vaunted the peach-tree. “Was
there ever such a perfect shade of color as I wear?
How it is set off by my green leaves!”</p>

<p>The little fir-tree, though tempted to envy them,
had a generous heart, and she said, “Your clothes
are indeed beautiful, O Apple-tree and Peach-tree!
I never saw more delicate and lovely coloring. Indeed,
I wish I might dress like that! I have my old
dull needles!”</p>

<p>“And see me!” cried the cherry-tree; “after all,
there’s nothing more beautiful than my pure white
with touches of feathery green.”</p>

<p>“True, true,” agreed the little fir-tree. “The
colors are all so lovely, I scarce know which to
choose.”</p>

<p>The fruit-trees tossed their blossomy branches,
and showers of dainty petals fell all around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the little fir-tree, enraptured, “I
never saw anything so wonderful! If only I had been
made like that!”</p>

<p>But the fruit-trees paid little heed to the fir-tree’s
lament, they were so busy admiring themselves and
flaunting their glories to the breeze.</p>

<p>Then the wood trees broke into their soft spring
greens.</p>

<p>“Look at me!” said a young maple, proudly; “is
not my pale yellowy green as lovely as the pink and
white of the fruit-trees?”</p>

<p>And gazing at the delicate shade of the tiny leaves,
the little fir-tree admitted that it was.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, with a deep sigh, “if I could have
that soft light green to wear, I wouldn’t ask for
pink blossoms! But how I hate my old dull needles!”</p>

<p>The oaks and elms put out their young green also,
and the feathery willows down by the brook waved
young withes like fairy wands.</p>

<p>As every fresh beauty unfolded, the poor little
fir-tree wept anew and wished the Tree-master had
given her the like. But so engrossed were the trees
in watching their own decorations that they paid
small heed to the sad little fir-tree.</p>

<p>And then summer came. The fir-tree felt sure new
beauties would come to the trees, and she almost
hoped some wonderful change might come to her.
But she watched and waited in vain.</p>

<p>The others, though! Ah, how they reveled in their
happiness!</p>

<p>The fruit-trees fairly laughed aloud under their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
happiness of fruit! Saucy red cherries, crimson velvet
peaches, mellow golden apples, dewy purple
plums, everywhere a riot of color, fragrance, and
sweetness!</p>

<p>How they boasted!</p>

<p>“Ah, little fir-tree,” they said: “what would you
give for glories like these?”</p>

<p>And the poor, forlorn little fir-tree shook with
sorrow to her very heart as she replied, “Ah, if I
might be like that!”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said the peaches, carelessly, and they
went about their business, which was to hold their
soft cheeks up toward the sun that he might kiss
them till they blushed.</p>

<p>“Yes, too bad!” chattered the pears, not heeding
what they were saying, as they swayed gently on
their stems while they slowly ripened to a golden
and rosy glow.</p>

<p>The poor little fir-tree shuddered at their cruel
indifference, which was even harder to bear than
their outright scorn.</p>

<p>And the shade-trees were just as bad.</p>

<p>And then autumn came. Oh, the triumphs of the
trees then! The wonderful flaming banners of
scarlet and gold that they flung out to dazzle all nature!
The rich depths of bronze and crimson that
lurked mysteriously in their thick foliage!</p>

<p>The little fir-tree marveled. “Is there no end to
their magnificence?” she thought: “must I ever see
more and more of these wonders that I may not
share?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>And the poor little thing wept until her needles
lay in a pool all around her feet. The willows down
by the brook saw her and they wept in sympathy.
The little fir-tree saw the weeping willows and she
was grateful for their kind thought, but so saddened
was she that she only wept more needles to the
ground.</p>

<p>And the nut-trees! They shook their nuts in her
very face, and taunted her afresh with her uselessness
and her lack of beauty.</p>

<p>The little fir-tree thought she would die.</p>

<p>And then the Tree-master came walking around.
“Hey, hey, what’s this?” he exclaimed, as he saw
the sadness of the little fir-tree.</p>

<p>In a burst of woe, the fir-tree told him all her
trials and sorrows.</p>

<p>“Oh, pooh, pooh,” said the old Tree-master, who
was really most kind-hearted, “have you forgotten
this? All through the winter the other trees will be
shivering and shaking in bare boughs. They will
have no beauty and they will be sad and forlorn.
You will be green and handsome, and then you can
ask them why they look so ugly and downcast.”</p>

<p>The fir-tree cheered up a little, for though not
vindictive, she had been so scorned by the other
trees that she was glad to look pretty in the winter
when they were forlorn and bare.</p>

<p>And yet, somehow, she felt it was not enough. To
be sure she was green and glossy and shapely, and
all the other trees looked really ugly, but she had
no gay-colored blossoms and no rich fruits or nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>The kind old Tree-master laughed when he heard
this. He was not so busy now, and he could listen
to the troubles of his little fir-tree.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” he said; “so you want fruit and flowers,
do you? Well, I rather guess we can fix that!
Hereafter you shall bear wonderful fruit and flowers
and nuts every winter, when the other trees are impatiently
waiting for spring. And the blossoms and
fruits you show shall far, far excel anything they
have ever flaunted in your face!”</p>

<p>The little fir-tree could scarcely believe this good
news. But it was true.</p>

<p>The Tree-master ordered that she should be the
Christmas Tree!</p>

<p>And so, every winter, the fir-tree blossoms out in
marvelous blooms of color and gold! Her branches
are hung with wondrous fruits such as never grew
on a summer tree! Nuts are there, and more holly
berries than the holly-tree herself ever showed! And
high above, crowning the glorified little fir-tree, the
Christmas star sheds its rays in a blessing never
bestowed on any other tree!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c22">SIR CLEGES<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>George Philip Krapp</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days of Uther, the father of King Arthur,
there lived a knight in England who was a member
of the famous Round Table, and his name was Sir
Cleges. Of all his knights none was dearer to King
Uther than Sir Cleges. There was nothing strange
in this, for everybody loved Sir Cleges, both because
he was brave and good and cheerful, and, above all,
because he was so generous. No poor man ever came
to Sir Cleges in vain. He was always ready to help
those upon whom sickness or the waste of war or
any other misfortune had fallen, and far and wide
he was known as the poor man’s friend. And not
only was Sir Cleges known for his charity to the
poor, but he was famous also for his generosity
toward those of his own rank and station in life.
His hall and his chambers were always filled with
guests, and his tables were always spread for those
who were hungry. There was no lack of the very best
food and drink in Sir Cleges’ house, and when good
food and drink are to be found, you may be sure
there will be plenty of friends to enjoy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Thus Sir Cleges and his fair wife, the Lady
Clarys, kept open house with the most generous hospitality.
Most of all at Christmas-time there were
great feasting and merriment in Sir Cleges’ castle.
From every corner of England the knights and their
ladies gathered there, and so cheerful and kind were
Sir Cleges and Lady Clarys, and so abundant was
the fare provided for all comers, that you might
have searched all through King Uther’s kingdom
and not have found any Christmas feasting happier
or more cheerful than that under Sir Cleges’ roof.</p>

<p>Thus for many years Sir Cleges lived in this generous
fashion, and never thought of his money except
as a means whereby he could help the needy or
give pleasure to his friends. But there is always an
end even to the longest purse, and, as time went on
and as Sir Cleges’ friends grew more numerous, it
took more and more to entertain them. All the money
he had, Sir Cleges spent freely; and when his money
was gone, he sold his cattle and other goods to keep
up his household. But this was soon used, and after
that Sir Cleges’ lands went the same way as his
money and his cattle. As long as he had a penny
left, said Sir Cleges, no friend should know the lack
of it. But at last, when Sir Cleges had nothing more
to sell and nothing in which the swarm of friends
who had gathered about him could find their pleasure
and profit, then straightway they heartlessly
left him.</p>

<p>Thus the good Sir Cleges, who had never thought
of his own welfare, but had spent all his substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
in order that others might be comfortable and
happy, now found himself deserted as soon as he
had nothing more to give. He was no longer able to
appear at King Uther’s court, and he who had been
one of the merriest and best loved of the knights of
the Round Table dropped quietly out of sight and
soon was altogether forgotten. With his wife and his
children, Sir Cleges went to live in the one poor
house that was left to him, and there in poverty and
obscurity he strove to forget the fickle friends who
had so readily forsaken him.</p>

<p>Now it happened some years after this that King
Uther decided to spend the Christmas-tide at the
royal castle of Cardiff, which stood not far from
Sir Cleges’ humble dwelling. Great preparations
were made for the Christmas feasting, and invitations
were sent out to all the brave knights of the
kingdom. On Christmas eve all the knights and their
ladies were come together at Cardiff, and then the
feasting began in earnest. The cooks and the servers
ran hither and thither, and all was excitement and
bustle. In the great hall, there were tumblers and
dancers and magicians to amuse the Christmas
feasters with their tricks and gamboling. Singers
and minstrels of all kinds had been summoned, and
the music of the pipes and trumpets and bugles was
heard far and wide. Nothing was spared that might
help to make the time speed rapidly and joyously
for all the assembled knights and their ladies.</p>

<p>In his little house not far away, Sir Cleges heard
the sounds of rejoicing in the great hall of the castle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
and it made him sad and bitter. He had not been invited
to the feasting, for long since he had been forgotten
and none of his old friends troubled to inquire
whether he was dead or living. “Many a happy
day,” said Sir Cleges, to the Lady Clarys, “have I
given to those who reck not now of my sorrow.” But
the Lady Clarys would not allow Sir Cleges to dwell
on thoughts of unkindness, and bade him consider
how much they still had to be grateful for, and thus
little by little she comforted him and brought him
again to contentment.</p>

<p>Thus the Christmas eve Sir Cleges and the Lady
Clarys spent quietly in their humble cottage, and
found such pleasure in the innocent joys and playfulness
of their happy children that they had no
longing for the noisy revelry of the courtiers in the
castle of Cardiff.</p>

<p>The next day was Christmas day, and, with good
will in their hearts for all men, Sir Cleges and the
Lady Clarys went to the church to give thanks for
their many blessings. Now after the church was over,
Sir Cleges walked in his garden; and after a time
he knelt down to pray beneath a cherry-tree that
stood in the midst of the garden. As Sir Cleges knelt,
praying, he suddenly felt a bough of the tree striking
him on the head, and, seizing hold of it and
springing to his feet, lo, what was his astonishment
to see the bough covered with green leaves and full
of cherries—red, ripe, and luscious! Picking one of
the cherries, Sir Cleges put it into his mouth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
it seemed to him he had never tasted anything so
delicious. Gathering more of the fruit, he ran into
the house and cried out, “Behold, Dame Clarys,
what a marvel is here!” And when the Lady Clarys
had come she could hardly believe her eyes. “Cherries
at Christmas-time!” she exclaimed. “How can
such a thing be!” And when Sir Cleges had told
her how he had been praying beneath the tree, how
he had felt a bough striking him on the head, and
how, when he took hold of it, he had found it filled
with green leaves and ripe fruit, then the Lady
Clarys believed that the cherries were real, and
great was her wonder at the marvel which had happened
in their little garden.</p>

<p>“Now hast thou indeed,” she said, “a present fit
for a king! No longer grieve that thou hast no
Christmas offering for the good King Uther, for
cherries such as these I doubt he has ever seen.”</p>

<p>And then the Lady Clarys counseled Sir Cleges
to gather the cherries and to put them in a basket
and bear them straightway as a present to the king.
And Sir Cleges, glad at heart that even in his poverty
he could do something to add to the joy of
the king’s Christmas feasting, readily consented so
to do.</p>

<p>To Cardiff Castle Sir Cleges took his way, and on
his arm he bore the basket of the wonderful fruit.
It was just dinner-time when Sir Cleges reached the
castle gate, and all the court were about to sit down
to meat. But when the porter at the gate saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
poverty-stricken man with a basket on his arm approaching
to enter, he drove him away with scorn
and reviling.</p>

<p>“Begone, old beggar,” he said, “with thy rags
and thy tatters! What have such as thou to do entering
kings’ castles? Let me see the last of thee, or
thou shalt not soon forget where thou belongest.”</p>

<p>“Pray let me through the gate, good porter,” answered
Sir Cleges, to this greeting. “I have here in
this basket a Christmas present for the king.”</p>

<p>“Thou a Christmas present for the king! A likely
story, in sooth! Show me what thou hast in thy
basket that thou thinkest worthy a king.”</p>

<p>And then, when Sir Cleges lifted the cover of the
basket and showed him the cherries, he was surprised
almost beyond speech. “Heaven defend us!”
he exclaimed; “cherries at Christmas-time! How
can such a thing be? Certainly this is a present
worthy a king. But listen, old man,” said he, greedily,
“thou shalt not pass through this gate unless
thou dost promise to give me a third of the reward
which the king shall give for the present thou bringest.”
And Sir Cleges, seeing no other way of passing
the gate, promised the porter that one third of
the reward should be his.</p>

<p>Now after Sir Cleges had passed by the porter,
he thought all would be well; but no sooner had he
reached the door of the hall than he was met by the
usher, who forbade him to go in.</p>

<p>“Out with thee, old fellow!” he exclaimed. “How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
cam’st thou here? This is no place for beggars and
basket-men such as thou.”</p>

<p>Then when Sir Cleges said he had a present in his
basket for the king, the usher, like the porter, must
see what the present could be.</p>

<p>“Holy Saint Peter!” he gasped, when Sir Cleges
had lifted the cover of the basket. “Cherries at
Christmas-time! How can such a thing be?”</p>

<p>But he soon recovered from his surprise and told
Sir Cleges he might go in, but only if he promised
that one third of the reward which the king gave
him should come to him. And Sir Cleges, thinking
how hard it was to do even a kindness to a king,
must needs promise as he had done before.</p>

<p>When Sir Cleges entered the great hall all was
bright and merry there. The knights and the ladies
of King Uther’s court, all decked in their finest
feathers and silks, were about to sit down to the
banquet. The serving-men went scurrying back and
forth from the kitchen, bearing platters of rich food
for the king’s feasters and stumbling over each
other in their excitement and hurry. The table was
hardly able to carry everything they wanted to put
upon it. There were great haunches of venison, and
roast swans and geese and ducks and pheasants by
the dozen. At each end, there stood a huge pasty
almost as big around as a cart wheel. The king’s
cooks had used all their art in concocting cakes and
pies and puddings, to say nothing of the sweetmeats
of marchpane molded into the forms of towers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
castles, or of knights on horseback, or baskets of
fruit and flowers, and various other fanciful and
astonishing structures. Everybody’s mouth was
watering, but the king was not yet ready to sit down
to the feasting, and the courtiers and their ladies
stood chatting and laughing merrily with one another.
All were too busy to pay any heed to the
shabby Sir Cleges, with the basket on his arm, until
the watchful eye of the king’s haughty steward happened
to fall upon him. Horrified to see such a
melancholy figure in the midst of so gay a company,
he hastened up to Sir Cleges and was hustling him
out of the hall with short ceremony before Sir
Cleges managed to say that he had a present for the
king.</p>

<p>“Beggars are not givers,” said the steward; “but
show me, what is the present thou dost bring?”</p>

<p>Then, when Sir Cleges had lifted the cover of the
basket and had shown him the cherries, he was no
less surprised than the others had been, nor was he
less greedy.</p>

<p>“Cherries at Christmas!” he exclaimed. “Whoever
heard of such a thing? But listen, sir,” said he,
in a low voice, “thou speakest not with the king unless
thou promise me one third of the reward he
gives thee.”</p>

<p>When Sir Cleges heard these words he thought to
himself: “Little enough am I to get out of this. If
I have a dinner for my pains, it’s as much as I may
look for.” But he said nothing until the steward
prodded him again, and then, seeing that there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
no other way of getting by this greedy officer, he
promised him a third of his reward, as he already
had done to the porter and the usher.</p>

<p>At last the way was free for Sir Cleges; and with
his precious basket, he made his way through the
throng of the courtiers to the place where the king
was seated on a dais.</p>

<p>“Receive, O King,” said he, falling on his knees
before King Uther, “this Christmas offering from
one of thy most humble subjects.”</p>

<p>And when King Uther looked into the basket and
saw that it was filled with luscious red cherries, he
too, like the Lady Clarys, could hardly believe his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Cherries at Christmas!” he cried. “Now certainly
this is a marvel, and a right worthy gift thou
has brought to us, good fellow.” Then when he had
tasted one of the cherries he declared a better cherry
he had never eaten. And then he gave some to each
of the knights and ladies; and they all wondered
greatly to see such fruit at that bleak season.</p>

<p>“The king’s thanks hast thou won,” said Uther to
Sir Cleges, “for thou hast made this Christmas
feasting forever memorable. But sit thou now at our
table and have part in our dinner, and afterward
thou shalt have whatever reward for thy gift that
thou askest.”</p>

<p>Then he motioned to the haughty steward to make
a place for Sir Cleges; and certainly a strange figure
this shabby knight made among all the gay lords
and their ladies. Little they thought that this humble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
stranger had once bestowed benefit upon many a
one of them, and little heed they paid to one whom
they took to be but a poor old gardener! But Sir
Cleges said nothing, and sat quietly at the table, to
his heart’s content enjoying all the good things the
king had provided for his Christmas dinner. And
though the best cooks of the land had shown there
all their skill and cunning, nothing at that feast was
so wonderful as the cherries which had been brought
by the humble stranger.</p>

<p>Now when the dinner was over, the king had not
forgotten the poor man who had brought him the unexpected
present, and summoning Sir Cleges to him,
he bade him ask whatever reward he would in return
for his welcome present. Then Sir Cleges bethought
himself of the promises he had made to the porter,
the usher, and the steward, and he said:</p>

<p>“Lord, King, this is the reward I ask: twelve
strokes of this good staff that I bear in my hand, to
be delivered on whomsoever it may please me within
this royal castle.”</p>

<p>“A strange fellow art thou!” answered the king,
in astonishment at this; “and from thy looks, thou
hadst done better to ask for something more worthy
my giving. But, since it is thy request, thou shalt not
find the king fail of his promise. Take thy strokes
and deliver them as thou see’st fit.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for thy boon, King Uther,” answered
Sir Cleges; “none other shall please me so well as
this one.”</p>

<p>And then, turning to the steward in the hall, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
his staff Sir Cleges gave him a blow on the shoulders
that made him bend double. “Three more thou gettest,”
he said, “for that is the full share coming to
thee!”</p>

<p>And with a right good will Sir Cleges gave the
three strokes, and left the proud steward groaning
with pain and terror. Then to the hall door Sir
Cleges made his way and delivered another four, no
less hearty and stinging, on the shoulders of the
astonished usher.</p>

<p>“There, thou hast thy share!” said Sir Cleges,
as he hastened to the gateway.</p>

<p>The porter greeted him eagerly, but he little
guessed what was coming. Four times Sir Cleges
lifted his staff and let it fall with all his might on
the back of the greedy porter. And this last third of
Sir Cleges’ boon you can be sure was not less light
than the others had been.</p>

<p>When Sir Cleges had thus delivered the three
thirds of the reward for his present, he found at his
elbow a messenger from the king, who bade him return
to the great hall of the castle. All the courtiers
and the king were still there and were listening to
a song the minstrel was singing. Now this song, as
it happened, was made about Sir Cleges himself, and
the minstrel was telling how this generous knight
had spent all his days making other people happy
and now was altogether lost and forgotten.</p>

<p>“Poor Sir Cleges!” sighed the king, “I loved
him well, but alas! I have no hope ever again to see
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>Just then, however, Sir Cleges knelt down before
the king and thanked him for the reward he
had given him, and told him that the twelve strokes
had been duly delivered.</p>

<p>“But I beseech thee, good fellow,” answered the
king, “tell me what the meaning of this may be. Why
were these strokes on the shoulders of my varlets
more pleasing to thee than a reward of gold or
silver?”</p>

<p>Then Sir Cleges told the king how the porter, the
usher, and the steward had each demanded a third
of his reward before they would permit him to make
his present, and he added, “May they learn thus to
be more free in giving and less greedy in demanding.
Perchance the next poor man may not find it
so hard to come into the king’s presence.”</p>

<p>When the king and his courtiers heard all this,
they laughed, and were delighted with the story.</p>

<p>“Well done,” said the king, “thou wielder of the
staff! Thou hast taught these knaves a good lesson.
How now, master steward, how likest thou thy share
of this fellow’s present?”</p>

<p>“May the fiends burn him in flames below!” muttered
the steward, as he rubbed the bruises on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Now the king was so pleased with all these happenings
that had made his Christmas feasting so
merry that he turned again to Sir Cleges and asked
him what his name was.</p>

<p>“My name, sire,” answered the poverty-stricken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
knight, “is one not unknown to thee in the days of
old. My name is Sir Cleges.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the king, “art thou the long-lost
Sir Cleges whom men to this day praise for his
good deeds and his charity?” And so moved with
joy was the good King Uther to find his old friend
again that he came down from his high seat and took
him by the hand and could not make enough of him.
When the courtiers saw how things were going, they
all flocked around Sir Cleges claiming his friendship
and acquaintance.</p>

<p>But the king did not stop with kind words. He
knew that a knight with a heart as true and loyal
as the heart of Sir Cleges was not easily to be found,
even among the knights of the Round Table, and
now he was determined never again to lose him. So
he gave to him the good castle of Cardiff to dwell
in and other lands and fees wherewith he might live
worthily.</p>

<p>Thus ended the king’s Christmas feasting in the
castle of Cardiff, and a happy day it was for the
knight Sir Cleges and the Lady Clarys. Many a long
year they lived in the noble castle the king had
given them, and you may be sure that no selfish porters
or ushers or stewards stood at the gates and
doorways to stop any poor man who would enter
there.</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Selma Lagerlöf</i></p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time,” said my Grandmother, as we
sat together one Christmas Day when all the others
had gone to church, “there was a man who went
out at night to borrow some fire. ‘Help me, kind
people,’ he said. ‘My wife has a little baby, and I
must light a fire to warm her and the child.’</p>

<p>“But it was very late, so everybody was asleep,
and no one answered.</p>

<p>“The man walked farther and farther on. At last
in the distance he saw the glimmer of flames, and,
going in that direction, he perceived that the fire
was burning in the open air. Around it lay sleeping
a flock of white sheep, watched by an old shepherd.</p>

<p>“When the man came up he saw that three large
dogs also rested asleep at the shepherd’s feet. Waking
at his approach, they opened their wide jaws
as if to bark, but no sound was heard. The man saw
the hair rise on their backs and their sharp teeth
glitter in the firelight as they rushed upon him. One
snapped at his legs, one at his hand, and a third
sprang at his throat. But neither jaws nor teeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
would obey and the man did not feel the smallest
hurt.</p>

<p>“He wanted to go on that he might get what he
needed. But the sheep lay so close together that
he could not move forward. So he stepped on the
animals’ backs, and walked across them to the fire.
But not a single one moved or stirred.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they move, Grandmother?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You will find out in a little while,” answered
Grandmother, and kept on with the story.</p>

<p>“When the man had almost reached the fire the
shepherd looked up. He was a surly old man, cross
and disagreeable to everybody. So when he saw the
stranger, he caught up the long, pointed staff he
carried in his hand while he was watching the flock,
and hurled it at him. The stick flew straight at the
man, but before it struck him, turned aside and
whizzed far over the field.”</p>

<p>Here I interrupted again. “Grandmother, why
didn’t the stick hit the man?” But she went on without
answering.</p>

<p>“Then the man said to the shepherd, ‘Good
friend, aid me by letting me have a little fire. My
wife has an infant child and I need it to warm them
both.’</p>

<p>“The shepherd would gladly have refused, but
when he thought that his dogs had not been able
to hurt the man, that the sheep had not run from
him, and his staff would not strike him, he felt a
little afraid, and did not dare to do so.</p>

<p>“‘Take as much as you need,’ he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“But the fire was almost out. There were no
branches or brands, only a heap of glowing embers,
and the stranger had nothing in which he could put
the coals.</p>

<p>“The shepherd saw this and was glad because the
man could get no fire. But the stranger stooped
down, took the coals from the ashes with his hands,
and put them in his cloak. And the coals neither
scorched his hands nor singed his cloak. The
man carried them away as if they were nuts or
apples.”</p>

<p>Here I interrupted a third time, “Grandmother,
why wouldn’t the coals burn the man?”</p>

<p>“You will soon hear,” she replied, and went on.</p>

<p>“When the shepherd, who was a sullen, bad-tempered
man, saw all these things, he began to
wonder: ‘What kind of night is this when the dogs
do not bite, the sheep feel no fear, the lance does
not kill, and fire does not burn?’ He called to the
stranger, asking: ‘Why is it that all things show
mercy upon you?’</p>

<p>“‘I cannot tell you if you do not see for yourself,’
said the man, and went away to light the fire
for his wife and child.</p>

<p>“But the shepherd wanted to find out what all
this meant, so he followed him and discovered that
the man did not even have a hut to live in, only
a sort of cavern with bare stone walls.</p>

<p>“The shepherd thought the poor little child might
be chilled, and though he was a harsh man, he pitied
and wanted to help it. So he gave the stranger a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
soft white sheepskin, and told him to put the child
in it.</p>

<p>“But the very moment he showed that he, too,
could be merciful, his eyes were opened and he saw
and heard what he had neither seen nor heard before.</p>

<p>“He saw a dense circle of silver-winged angels,
each with a harp in his hand, and all singing that
on this night was born the Saviour, who would redeem
the world from its sin.</p>

<p>“Then the shepherd understood why on this
night all creatures were so happy that they did not
desire to harm anything.</p>

<p>“The angels were not only around the shepherd,
but he saw them everywhere. They were in the cave,
on the mountains, and flying under the sky. They
came in throngs along the way, and, as they passed,
stopped and gazed at the child.</p>

<p>“There were joy and happiness and mirth and
singing, and he saw all this amid the darkness of
the night, where he had formerly seen and heard
nothing. And he was so happy that his eyes were
opened—that he fell on his knees and thanked God.”</p>

<p>Then Grandmother sighed, saying, “But what the
shepherds saw, we could see, too, for the angels
are flying over the earth every Christmas Eve, if we
could only see them.”</p>

<p>And Grandmother laid her hand on my head, adding,
“Remember this, for it is as true as that I
see you and you see me. It does not depend upon
candles and lamps, or on the moon and sun, but what
we need is eyes to behold the glory of God.”</p>

</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Marian Willard</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Christmas morning—the very day when
twins should be having the merriest time in the
world. But Betty and Bob were not merry at all;
they sat and looked at each other and hardly knew
whether to laugh or to cry.</p>

<p>“That letter is the best present we could have
had, anyway,” said Betty as she looked again at the
big special-delivery stamp. “It means that mother
is out of danger and that we shall be at home in
a month.”</p>

<p>A month before that when mother was first taken
sick, the twins had been sent to Uncle Ben’s so that
their own house should be very, very still. They
had played on the big farm, had gone to school in
the queer little old schoolhouse and watched for
the rural delivery postman to bring them letters
from home.</p>

<p>Christmas at home meant days of shopping,
treats when Uncle Tom came home from college,
parties at the church and at the schoolhouse, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
Santa Claus, fat and jolly, ringing his little tinkling
bells, ting-a-ling-aling! on the street corners. Besides
that, Christmas at home meant planning for
weeks ahead a gift that would bring Christmas
cheer to some little child that was poor.</p>

<p>“Bobby, do you remember how pleased little
Johnny Granger was when you gave him that pair
of skates?”</p>

<p>“I guess I do! They were the first skates he had
ever had! You gave his little sister a pair of rubber
boots the same year. How happy she was with
them! She wore them to school all winter whether it
rained or not. I wish we could have some kind of
a Christmas this year, just to keep from forgetting
what day it is. There isn’t even snow,” and Bob
looked with disgust at the bare, brown fields that
stretched away in front of the little old farmhouse.
“At home they’ve all been so worried over mother
that probably no one has had time to buy us presents.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bobby, mother is better and that is the best
present in all the world for us,” and Betty smiled
bravely at her brother.</p>

<p>“I wish we could make a Christmas for somebody
else,” said Bobby slowly. “There aren’t any
poor people like the Granger family up here. Besides,
we couldn’t buy anything anyway, for there
aren’t any stores. Isn’t this the strangest Christmas
you ever saw?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob, it is. No place to spend money; woods
full of Christmas trees and no presents to put on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
them; no one who needs help; no snow or skating
or company. We are going to have a fine Christmas
dinner, though. Uncle Ben killed a pair of fat
chickens yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And I’m going to crack butternuts right now,”
said Bobby, and he jumped up and left his twin sister
to romp with Buddy, the collie, who ran up to
her and thrust his soft nose into her hand, teasing
for a game of tag.</p>

<p>“O Buddy, Buddy, I’ll give <i>you</i> a Christmas
present,” and Betty ran upstairs and came flying
down again with a big blue ribbon in her hand.</p>

<p>“There, old fellow,” she said as she tied a huge
bow on Buddy’s collar, “you are going to have a
Christmas present.” As she spoke she clapped her
hands and ran for Bobby. “O, Bob, hurry up and
finish your butternuts. I think we can have a Christmas
after all. Hurry! Hurry!” Betty ran to find
Uncle Ben and whisper something in his ear. She
began to do the queerest things. Up to the attic she
ran and down again, her arms full of big boxes and
little ones; then down to the cellar, and up with an
armful of carrots and apples; then out to the barn,
and back with a box of corn and oats.</p>

<p>By that time Bobby had cracked all the butternuts
for dinner and stood with his hands in his pockets,
watching his sister. “What in the world are you doing?”
he said with a grin.</p>

<p>Betty grinned at him. “You take the axe and go
over to the upland pasture and cut down a little
Christmas tree; Uncle Ben said we could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“But we haven’t a thing to put on the tree.”</p>

<p>“We shall have something when you get back.
Uncle Ben will take Mollie and meet you and haul
the tree home.”</p>

<p>Bob went off, wondering, and Betty began to snip
up pieces of an old gray flannel shirt of Uncle Ben’s
and to rummage in the button box for old shoe buttons.</p>

<p>When Bob drove in with Uncle Ben and the little
tree, Betty dangled in front of him seven gray mice
by their tails of string. With shoe buttons for eyes
and bodies made of gray flannel they looked so real
that Uncle Ben jumped when he saw them.</p>

<p>“My land, child, those mice would fool any cat
in the county!”</p>

<p>“Smell,” answered Betty, and she dangled her
treasures under her uncle’s nose.</p>

<p>“Catnip mice,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>“I guess I know now who your poor folks will be
this year. They haven’t a cent to their name, nor a
shirt to their backs,” laughed Bobby, “but why
the tree?”</p>

<p>Such a busy morning as the twins had after that!
Bob set up the tree in the middle of the big barn.
Betty made little bundles that were as mysterious as
any Christmas package you ever saw. Then she
hung them on the tree; a package of meat cut fine
for Buddy, marked with his name in big letters;
seven catnip mice hung by their string tails for
the seven cats on the farm; four carrots tied in a
bunch of hay for Mollie; four apples tied in hay for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
Duke, the old gray horse; lumps of sugar in little
bundles for Buddy and Duke and Mollie.</p>

<p>Then Betty was puzzled. She ran to Uncle Ben.
“What does a cow like best?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Well, my cows like cornstalks. There is a pile
back of the old barn.”</p>

<p>So there were bundles of cornstalks at the base
of the tree. Betty tied them in loose bunches for the
cows. On the floor, too, stood a big bag of corn for
the hens.</p>

<p>After dinner the fun began. Everyone put on a
sweater and went to the barn, Buddy at Betty’s
heels proud of his new bow. Not all the cats could
be found, but five of them came in answer to Aunt
Martha’s call. Buddy took his meat and without a
single “thank you” ran to an empty stall to eat it.
The horses nodded “thank you” as they ate the
sugar and the carrots and the apples that the children
held out to them. Cats and kittens played with
their catnip mice and lapped up saucers of milk.
Mother Bunch slapped the gray kitten because he
tried to steal her catnip mouse. The cows crunched
their cornstalks and looked with mild surprise at
the queer antics of the kittens. Bob carried the
heavy pail of corn out to the hen yard and Betty fed
the chickens which crowded to her feet.</p>

<p>When the children went back to the barn with
the empty pail, they themselves had a surprise. A
wild gray squirrel had stolen in at the open door,
and was sitting up on his hind legs under the Christmas
tree, eating the corn that had been spilled;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
and he seemed as much at home as if he had been invited
to the party.</p>

<p>“I guess he must be our poor family,” laughed
Betty as she threw him another handful of corn.</p>

<p>“Twinnies,” suddenly called a man’s voice from
the yard. Only father called like that. The twins
turned, and there he stood in the door of the barn,
smiling at them. They rushed to his arms. How
happy they were to see him.</p>

<p>“So you youngsters had a tree for the penniless
poor, did you?” he said with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, run into the house with your father and
I’ll see what this tree will have for you,” said Uncle
Tom, who stood just behind their father, his arms
loaded with bundles.</p>

<p>In less time than you would have thought it could
be done, Uncle Tom had the tree ready for Betty
and Bob.</p>

<p>“We have to start for home by five o’clock, so
you children had better open your bundles right
now,” said father. The twins did not need to be told
twice. Eagerly they opened the packages, gay with
ribbons and seals. There were books, snowshoes, a
red silk umbrella for Betty and a pair of skating
boots for Bob; candy, a gold piece for each twin
from Uncle Tom; and best of all, a little pencil note
from mother to tell them that she was really better
and to wish them a merry Christmas.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bobby as the big car drove out of
the yard with father and Uncle Tom, “this hasn’t
been such a queer Christmas, after all.”</p>

</div>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Zona Gale</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> Anthony punched his small, hard pillow, to
make it as large as possible, so that his head would
come well above the level of the window sill. Wonderful,
thick, Christmas-looking snow was falling,
though it wanted two days yet to Christmas.</p>

<p>“Mother!” he cried, “I wish all the snow in the
world would come and fall in front of our window!”</p>

<p>“It looks as if it had come,” said Mother Margaret.</p>

<p>That was what he usually called her—Mother Margaret:
“Because that’s your name!” he said.
“Everybody calls you Margaret, in letters. Nobody
but me says ‘Mother.’”</p>

<p>“You want your head to be higher, don’t you?”
she said now, and put down the paper roses which,
all day long, she made for a great factory.</p>

<p>She brought him her own pillow, and under that
she folded a bed-comforter. The poor little room had
not a single cushion.</p>

<p>“Now!” she cried, “you can see all the snow there
is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>At any rate, Anthony could see nothing but snow—snow,
and the dim rectangle of the Window
Across.</p>

<p>The Window Across was the back window of an
apartment which faced the avenue. Anthony’s window
faced the court, and was over a store. There
were three floors of families over the store, because
the rooms were too old and inconvenient to use for
offices. The Window Across had thin rose silk curtains
at the casement and often, in the evening, one
could look straight through to the front window and
see bright moving figures and an unbelievable dinner
table, all made of bright things. And two or three
times, for ecstatic minutes, a little girl had come and
stood at the Window Across. Once, indeed, she had
come right away out on the fire-escape and stood
there, dancing and laughing in the cold, until a white-capped
maid had run in a panic and carried her in.
Anthony’s window had been open then, and he had
heard the maid cry: “Dear Child!”</p>

<p>So he always called her Dear Child.</p>

<p>He lay now looking through the snow to the Window
Across, and imagining that the snow lay so deep
that they were at last obliged to make a tunnel from
one window to another, so that anybody could get
out at all. But it was always he and Mother Margaret
who went down the tunnel to the Window
Across—never the others who came up, because the
little room was so bare and so shabby and so unlike
the room he imagined beyond the rose silk curtains.
And always he was well and strong instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
obliged to lie in bed, as he had lain now for almost
a year, to give strength to the poor back, wrenched
and threatened by a fall.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he looked, a beautiful thing happened.
The silk curtains parted in the Window
Across, the white-capped maid stood there, and she
hung in the window a great wreath of Christmas
holly tied with a scarlet bow.</p>

<p>Anthony sat up, and cried out and waved his thin
little arms.</p>

<p>“Mother Margaret, Mother Margaret!” he cried.
“Look—oh, look-at!”</p>

<p>Mother Margaret came and looked, and she exclaimed
too, with something of pleasure—but
through the pleasure there went darting and stabbing
a pain which had been coming again and again
these past few days; and as Christmas Day drew
nearer, it had been hurting her more and more. It
had come that morning when she had first waked.
And she had said to herself, for the hundredth
time:</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> the use? You can buy him some fruit—a
big orange and a red apple. You can manage a
little something for Christmas dinner. But you can’t
do anything else, and what <i>is</i> the use in thinking
about it?”</p>

<p>She put down her paper flowers now, and went
over to Anthony’s bed.</p>

<p>“Tony, dear,” she said, “I <i>believe</i> you’re thinking
about Christmas.”</p>

<p>He looked up, bravely and brightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“No, Mother, truly,” he said, “I wasn’t thinking
about it hardly at all.”</p>

<p>She sat down on the bedside and took his hand.
“You do know, don’t you, love,” she said, “that
Mother Margaret can’t—she sure-enough can’t—do
anything for our Christmas this year! But another
year—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” Tony agreed eagerly, “another
year!”</p>

<p>“This year things are bad enough,” she said;
“but if Mother thought that—somewhere in his
little heart, he wasn’t quite believing her, and was
thinking that maybe, <i>maybe</i> some kind of Christmas
would come to him, why, then—”</p>

<p>Her voice stopped of its own will—stopped, and
steadied itself bravely, and went on again:</p>

<p>“Why, then,” she said, “Mother just couldn’t
bear it <i>at all</i>.”</p>

<p>“Truly, Mother, truly!” said Anthony. “I know
we can’t—I do know. Oh, but—why, Mother Margaret!
That’s what makes it so nice to see the
wreath! It’s just as if we almost had a wreath in
our window—isn’t it, though?”</p>

<p>“Almost, almost,” she said, and went back to her
paper flowers. She had six dozen red roses to make
before Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>“And then the snow,” Anthony was saying
eagerly. “Why, Mother, it’s like all the Christmas
pictures. It’s like the Christmas cards. And oh,
Mother,—think! It’s just as nice and white for us
as if we lived no matter where!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said his mother bitterly, “the snow and
the cold are about the only things that are the same
for us as for everybody.”</p>

<p>Anthony half closed his eyes and lay watching
happily. Mother Margaret went on with her roses.
As she worked, her lips were moving. But she was
not counting the petals, as one would have supposed.
She was counting, as she almost always counted,
what she had in her purse and what she <i>must</i> spend.
And when one counts like this, all day long, it begins
to show in one’s face, in one’s voice, in all one’s
ways. Anthony was seven. It was six years since
his father had died. And every year of these six
years she had been fighting to keep Anthony with
her. But this meant that she counted all day long.</p>

<p>At five o’clock Mother Margaret went out with
half her roses. At the factory she sent them in and
asked, as she did each time, for more tissue paper.
The manager looked doubtful. Had she enough to
finish her order? Oh, yes, she said; but she carried
a little back at each delivery. The man returned. She
would have to wait—everyone was busy with the
rush mail orders. They could give out no paper till
Monday.</p>

<p>As she went out, she lingered and looked about
her. She did not guess what a pretty picture she made
in her old brown coat and hat which just matched
her eyes. What about all these women, she was wondering.
Some of them must have little children at
home. And they must have to count almost as much as
she counted. She wished that she knew how they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
meant to manage about Christmas. Was there anything
that she could do, if she knew how to do it,
for Anthony’s Christmas?</p>

<p>A middle-aged woman was packing boxes near
her. Mother Margaret went shyly to her.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she said, “could you tell me anything
you know how to do for a child’s Christmas?
Something that won’t—that doesn’t—”</p>

<p>The woman leaned on the box for a moment. She
nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “no. Everything costs now. Did
you ever try using the flowers?”</p>

<p>“The flowers?” Mother Margaret questioned.</p>

<p>“They decorate grand,” said the woman. “You
can get a lot made up ahead, and string them around
the room. You can make a tree look lovely with ’em,
and nothing else. And it don’t hurt ’em none. Take
’em down, and they’re like new.”</p>

<p>Why had she never thought of that! She thanked
the woman joyfully.</p>

<p>Mother Margaret flew along the street for the mile
which she walked to save car fare, her head filled
with visions. The pink and white and green tissue
paper was there in their room; it was not hers, and
it had not occurred to her that she could use it. But,
just for one evening to borrow the flowers before
she sent them out—oh, nobody could mind that. She
could make the room beautiful, she could make a tree
beautiful! But she knew she could not afford a tree.</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, which Mother Margaret
could do. She had brought her library card<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
in expectation of it. She went into the little branch
library near where she lived, and eagerly to the
desk. In these days before the holidays there was
almost no one in the room. The pleasant-faced young
woman at the desk had time to greet her with unusual
cordiality.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mother Margaret, her cheeks flushed
from her long walk, “I want you to find me a book.
A book that a little child will like. A book all pictures.
A Christmas book, if you can.”</p>

<p>“That ought to be easy,” the pleasant-faced
young woman said, and went with her to the shelves,
asking questions.</p>

<p>At the first book which she found and offered,
Mother Margaret shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “it’s got to be—to be larger than
that. Thicker, I mean—it’s got to last longer. You
see,” she explained, flushing still more, “I want it
to last my little boy all day long, on Christmas. It’s
about the only Christmas he’s going to have.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the woman quietly.</p>

<p>“And then,” Mother Margaret said, “if you had
something about modeling. About modeling in
clay—”</p>

<p>“Does your little boy model in clay?” the librarian
asked.</p>

<p>Mother Margaret flushed again. “He never has
had any clay or any tools,” she said; “but he loves
to read about it.”</p>

<p>They found two books, one on clay modeling, and
one with many pictures, and a story of somebody’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
wonderful Christmas that came when none was expected.
Then the librarian considered for a moment,
looking at a colored sheet of birds on the bulletin-board;
she took down the poster, rolled and tied it
and, from the bowl on her desk, fastened a sprig
of holly in the cord.</p>

<p>“Flowers and birds and a piece of holly!” Mother
Margaret cried, and thanked her joyfully.</p>

<p>She bought her red apple and a great orange,
looked longingly at a window of chocolates, and ran
home with her treasures.</p>

<p>As she was leaving the things in the sitting-room,
on her own bed, she heard Anthony calling her.</p>

<p>“Mother—oh, Mother! Come here!” he shouted
excitedly. When she ran to him he was sitting up—his
face as near to the window as he could get.</p>

<p>“Look at! <i>Look</i> at!” he said. “They’ve brought
home their Christmas tree! They’ve hid it on the
fire-escape!”</p>

<p>And there, leaning against the wall of the fire-escape,
outside the Window Across, was a beautiful,
tapering evergreen tree, sent home for Christmas
and hidden outside there, unquestionably to surprise
the Dear Child.</p>

<p>Anthony and his mother sat on the bed and looked
at this tree. And presently they began to plan. On
the very tip-top would be the star—or would it be
the angel? They decided on the star. Below would
come the ornaments, the candles, the nuts wrapped
in silver paper, the pink hanging bags of candy, the
pop-corn strings. All this Mother Margaret arranged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
because she had seen many Christmas trees,
and Anthony never had seen any. But there was one
thing that he could plan.</p>

<p>“And then,” he said, “right close under the tree,
would be the box all full of clay and things to model
with!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mother Margaret agreed, with a catch
in her voice. “That should be there, without a
doubt.” Then she whispered to him.</p>

<p>“Tony, dear,” she said. “I’ve no Christmas for
you. But I have got a little surprise.”</p>

<p>Her heart ached at the leaping delight in his eyes
as he looked up at her.</p>

<p>“Not a gift, dear,” she hastened to say. “Just a
little something for us to look at—oh, Tony, it isn’t
much at all!” she broke off.</p>

<p>“Why, Mother,” Tony said, “a little much is <i>almost</i>
as nice as a great big much, you know!”</p>

<p>The gayety with which she had come in was slipping
away, now that she had seen the tree for the
Dear Child. Presently she went in the other room
and opened the box where she kept the tissue paper.
But the flowers would be something, after all, in the
dull little room on Christmas Day. She lifted out the
sheets, and stood staring at them. There were not
more than three dozen sheets, and she had three
dozen of the roses yet to make. One rose required
a sheet of paper. These must be delivered by Christmas
Eve—to-morrow night! No more paper would
be given out till Monday. She could not even have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
the flowers for Anthony on Christmas day....</p>

<p><i>If only Christmas were to-morrow!</i></p>

<p>She went back into Anthony’s room and sat down
beside his bed. She dreaded to tell him that even the
poor “little much” of a surprise was not to be his.
She put it off until they should have had their supper.
After supper, in the dark, they could just see
the tall shadow of the Christmas tree leaning
against the opposite wall in the snow. Presently the
Window Across flamed bright with the lighted
globes within the room.</p>

<p>The tall Christmas tree there against the wall!
Mother Margaret sat and stared at it. It seemed
such a waste that it should be there all this time,
with no one enjoying it. It seemed such a waste that
it should stand there to-morrow, with no one enjoying
it. It would be just as beautiful, decorated
now, as it would be on Christmas Day....</p>

<p>And then Mother Margaret’s heart stood still at
what it thought. But it thought about it once, it
thought about it twice, and then it began to beat as
Mother Margaret’s heart did not often beat any
more. She sprang up and stood looking out the
window, across the court to the tree. Could she possibly
bring herself to do it? Would she dare? What
would they think—what would they do—Oh, but she
must try!</p>

<p>“Tony,” she said, “Mother must go out again
now, for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>She slipped down to the street, and around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
corner to the avenue. There was no difficulty in distinguishing
the apartment building. She walked
boldly in the door and to the elevator.</p>

<p>“Fourth,” she said with confidence.</p>

<p>The white-capped maid opened the door. She
looked at Mother Margaret as a stranger, and
Mother Margaret wanted to say: “Oh, but I know
you very well!” Only, when she had seen her before,
in the Window Across, she had looked quite small
and like anybody; whereas she seemed now a person
towering infinitely tall.</p>

<p>“I want,” said little Mother Margaret, quite loud
and bold, “to see your mistress. At once.”</p>

<p>The maid looked at her perplexedly. Small and
pretty persons in shabby brown with nice voices and
the ways of a lady did not often come knocking at this
door demanding to see the mistress, and not by
name.</p>

<p>“I don’t think—” the maid began doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Tell her that I shall not keep her,” said Mother
Margaret clearly. “But I must see her. Tell her that
I do not know her, but that I am her neighbor, across
the court.</p>

<p>Then the maid gave way. There is something about
that word “neighbor” that is a talisman. With,
“I’ll see,” the maid ushered her in. She stood
weakly in the small and pretty reception-room while
the maid went to call her mistress. Then there came
a step, and a voice.</p>

<p>Mother Margaret hardly looked at this woman.
She saw someone in gray, with a practical face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
concern; then she saw nothing but direct and rather
pleasant eyes looking into hers.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Mother Margaret, simply, “you
have out on your fire-escape a little Christmas tree.
Christmas isn’t till day after to-morrow. To-morrow,
for a little while, could you lend me that tree?”</p>

<p>“Lend you—” repeated the woman, uncertainly.</p>

<p>“I live just back of you,” Mother Margaret went
on breathlessly. “I saw the tree. I thought—if you
could lend it to me a little while to-morrow—oh, just
as it is! and just till you get ready to trim it. I could
bring it back quite promptly. Nothing should happen
to it. And I could fix it up—just for a little while.
My—my little boy never has seen a tree trimmed,”
she added.</p>

<p>“My dear!” said the woman.</p>

<p>This, Mother Margaret thought, would be the exclamation
at the impossibility of doing anything so
wild. She looked miserably down at the floor. And
so she did not see someone else come into the room,
until a soft quick step was close beside her.</p>

<p>“Why,” this newcomer said, “Mother! This is a
friend of mine!”</p>

<p>Then Mother Margaret looked up, straight into
the eyes of the pleasant-faced woman of the library.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Mother Margaret. “Oh!” And for
a moment said no more. “I never knew I was going
to ask this of you—when you’ve done so much!”
she cried at last.</p>

<p>She turned to the older woman in mute apology.
And she was actually filled with wonder when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
saw that the eyes of the older woman were shining
with tears.</p>

<p>They went into the little living-room and talked
it over, how it could be managed. The two women
saw—because they looked with the heart—that there
must be no thought of the gift of another tree. It
must be just as Mother Margaret had suggested. The
tree must be lent for a part of to-morrow and returned
in time for them to trim it on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>“For the Dear Child,” said Mother Margaret;
and then blushed beautifully. “Tony and I call her
that,” she said.</p>

<p>“With that, they called the Dear Child to the room.
The white-capped maid was putting her to bed, and
brought her in, partly undressed, with surprisingly
fat legs and arms and surprisingly thick curls.</p>

<p>“Honey,” the older woman said, “a little boy
lives across the court. This is his mama.”</p>

<p>The Dear Child opened wide eyes.</p>

<p>“I know that little bit o’ boy,” she announced.
“He—he—he—lives in the bed!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mother Margaret said sorrowfully, “he
lives in the bed.”</p>

<p>“Say him a kiss,” the Dear Child said sleepily,
and was carried back to her undressing.</p>

<p>So then it was arranged that when the maid was
free, she should come bringing the Christmas tree
round to the door of Mother Margaret’s flat.</p>

<p>“I could carry it,” Mother Margaret insisted.</p>

<p>But no, it must be, it seemed, exactly as they said.
Mother Margaret must be there to have left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
outer door ajar, and to amuse the little boy and keep
his attention while the tree was put into the other
room. She must pin a handkerchief on the open door
so that there should be no mistake. And then on no
account must she leave the little boy when she heard
the tree set in the other room, or else he would hear,
and wonder. Would she do all this, exactly as they
told her to?</p>

<p>There was no thanking them. Perhaps Mother
Margaret’s broken words, though, were better
thanks than any perfect utterance.</p>

<p>She ran home, through a maze of lights and windows
which danced and nodded and all but held out
their hands. It is strange and sorrowful, at Christmas
time, how much more, if you are going to have
Christmas joy, the lights and windows seem to mean
Christmas than if you are going to have none.</p>

<p>When she went in she saw that Tony had fallen
asleep. His little pillow was still bunched, hard and
round, on her own and on the folded quilt. And his
face was still turned toward the Window Across.</p>

<p>She sat down to wait. She would not wake him.
Until after the maid had been there with the tree,
she would not even risk lighting the gas and working
at the flowers. She sat almost an hour in the
dusk. The outer door of the other room was standing
faithfully ajar, with a handkerchief pinned to a
panel, and the light there burning low. She could
have been sure that she would hear the lightest step
in the next room; and then, since Anthony was
asleep, she meant to disregard their injunctions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
slip to the door for a word of gratitude for the maid.
But when she fancied that she heard a sound, and
caught a shadow, and when she had hurried to the
door, she stood mute and hardly breathing in her
wonderment. No one was there—save indeed a presence.
And the presence was the tree, standing neatly
erect in its small, green box—and hung from top to
base with popcorn and tinsel and ornaments which,
even in that dim light, glittered like angels and like
stars.</p>

<p>Mother Margaret went in and sat down on her
little bed, and looked at the wonder of it. And before
she knew that it might possibly happen to her she
had hidden her face in her hands and was sobbing.</p>

<p>A stir from Anthony sent her back to his room.
He was moving in the little bed “where he lived,”
and Mother Margaret wiped her eyes and lighted
the gas, and wondered how she could keep the happy
news.</p>

<p>She went to him to arrange his pillow. He opened
his eyes and smiled—as all his life long he had never
failed to smile when first he opened his eyes and
saw her. Then, at some memory, the eyes flew wide.</p>

<p>“Is to-morrow Christmas, Mama?”</p>

<p>Without just the combination of events which had
set her head whirling, Mother Margaret would never
have answered as she did.</p>

<p>“Yes, darling. To-morrow is Christmas.”</p>

<p>His face lighted, “<i>Is</i> it?” he cried. “Is it tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said again, “to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>“Will the s’prise be when I wake up?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “the surprise will be when you
wake up.”</p>

<p>He smiled again, and drifted off to sleep. As she
smoothed the tumbled covers, the old grip and terror
came to her at sight of the little wasted body.
The momentary qualm which she had felt died away.
Why should he not believe that it was Christmas
Day? She knew the heart of a child, knew that the
day makes all the difference. Tony should think
that he had one Christmas, in any case!</p>

<p>It was past one o’clock when she finished the last
of the roses. Tony was sleeping heavily. She turned
down the gas and went to work.</p>

<p>The bed, left from the days of her housekeeping,
had a high, slender white frame, meant to hold a
canopy. From this down to the foot posts ran two
cords carrying roses, and roses ran along the foot
rail. Working slowly and quietly, she brought the
tree from the other room to stand by his side. She
had not yet had time to examine the ornaments—she
and Tony could do that together. His stocking,
the poor little disused stocking, with the big red
apple and the orange, she tied to a bough reaching
toward the little boy, like a friendly hand. The library
books were spread open at pages of bright
pictures. The chart of colored birds was pinned to
the wall. The sprig of holly was fastened to the coverlet.
At the last moment, from scraps of her green
tissue, she had fashioned a semblance of holly
wreath, with a bit of red paper twisted here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
there for berries. She slipped behind the bed, and
hung the wreath in the window. When, in the “little
hours,” she crept to her own bed, she was without
fatigue.</p>

<p>She woke at dawn, and was dressed and back in
his room before he had opened his eyes. She lighted
the gas, and then she kissed him.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Tony!” she cried.</p>

<p>He struggled up, lovely with sleep. And in upon
his dreams came the lines of the roses, and the soft
greenness and beauty and brightness of the tree.
He sat up, his head thrown back, an expression of
almost angelic wonder in his believing face. And he
was, with all his joy, a practical little Tony.</p>

<p>“W-w-where’d you get that?” he cried. “Oh,
Mama! Mama! Mama!”</p>

<p>And there was something in his cry that opened
Mother Margaret’s heart like a flower.</p>

<p>A child before its <i>first</i> Christmas tree, that is an
experience apart. Tony was mute. Tony was shouting.
Tony was leaning forward to touch things. Tony
was leaning far back to win the effect of the whole.
Tony was absolutely and unutterably happy.</p>

<p>So was Mother Margaret—for a while. Then Tony
said an unexpected thing.</p>

<p>“Think,” he said, “that little Jesus was born to-day.
Really, truly to-day.”</p>

<p>Mother Margaret looked at him.</p>

<p>“They cannot tell surely, which day, you know,
son,” she said uncertainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it was to-day!” Tony told her positively. “I
know it was to-day.”</p>

<p>Then, when he took in his hands the library picture
book, there was the story of Bethlehem of
Judea, and she must read it to him, and he listened
as if he were hearing it for the first time.</p>

<p>“It was this morning!” he said over dreamily.
“The Star in the East was this morning, Mother
Margaret. It seems true, now I’ve seen my tree,”
he added quaintly.</p>

<p>He seemed possessed with the idea of “to-dayness.”</p>

<p>“Think,” he said again, “all little boys is got a
tree now. Right now. And me, too!”</p>

<p>It was a long, enchanted day; and she waited until
the final possible moment to close it.</p>

<p>“Tonykins,” she said at last, “now the roses have
to come down while Mama puts them into a box and
takes them to their own family. And while she’s
gone, you can lie here and look at the tree, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Anthony, “an’—an’ it’ll talk to me!”</p>

<p>Unquestionably the tree talked to Tony. But the
amazing thing was that it also talked to his mother,
on her way down to the factory.</p>

<p>No sooner was she on the street from the happy
holiday humor of their room than she was faced accusingly
by the bustle and clamor of the streets
on “the night before Christmas.” Everyone was
intent on something outside himself. Everyone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
Mother Margaret thought, would have known it was
Christmas, if he had not been told.</p>

<p><i>All save Tony.</i> Her heart smote her when she
thought of that. For Tony in the little bed where
he “lived,” all the blessedness and peace of tomorrow
had descended to-day, and he had lived
them faithfully. And on Christmas morning, on Star
of Bethlehem morning for all the rest of the world,
it would all be past for him; when for all the rest
of the world it would be dawning....</p>

<p>Christmas dinner they ate together on Christmas
Eve, there at Tony’s bedside, with a royal feast of
one thing extra, spread on a little sewing table set
in the shadow of the tree.</p>

<p>“Now, dear,” said Mother Margaret when they
had finished, “the twenty-four hours is almost up,
and the fairy is going to come for the tree. You’re
sure you won’t mind—aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Mother!” Tony’s eyes were fastened
on the tree as if he feared it might vanish if he
looked away.</p>

<p>“And you are going to feel more glad that you
had it than sorry to see it go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Mother!”</p>

<p>Tony’s eyes were still on the tree.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he said, “I wish Christmas was to-morrow,
too. I like to feel like I feel when it’s
Christmas.”</p>

<p>She sat beside him, silent, when outside the door
came the tread and tap which they were both expecting.
And somewhat to her bewilderment Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
Margaret admitted four visitors. There was the
kindly, practical woman; and the librarian with the
pleasant eyes; and the maid with the Dear Child
in her arms.</p>

<p>She set the Dear Child down, and the Dear Child
ran to Tony’s bed, and in her hands was a box.</p>

<p>“Little boy!” she shouted. “See what! See what!”</p>

<p>She laid something beside him. And when, trembling
a little with the wonder of it, Tony had unwound
this, there lay his longed-for clay and some
unbelievable modeling tools. Mother Margaret’s eyes
flew to the librarian. And the look of the two women
met and clung, with something living in the faces of
them both. And so it came about that when the maid
drew the little tree from the room, Tony hardly
knew.</p>

<p>They went away with happy greetings, and waving
hands, and promises to meet again.</p>

<p>“I—I—I—bring you my kitty and my fimbel!”
shouted the Dear Child kissing her hand. “That
other day,” she added importantly.</p>

<p>An hour later Tony opened his eyes sleepily.</p>

<p>“Make a great big racket, Mother Margaret!” he
surprisingly demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, dear?” she asked.</p>

<p>“’Cause if I go to sleep, then it won’t be Christmas
any more,” said Tony, and drifted off with his
smile still on his face.</p>

<p>Christmas morning, the true Christmas morning,
came with a white mantle and a bright face. Mother
Margaret woke to hear the city one tumbling peal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
of early bells. She sprang up and threw on her dressing
gown, with her pretty hair falling about her
shoulders, and ran to Tony’s room. He was still
asleep. Resolutely, and even joyously, she stooped
and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Tony, dear!” she said—but there was something
like a sob in her voice. “Wake up! It’s Christmas
morning!”</p>

<p>His eyes flew open, and stared straight into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s Christmas morning,” she repeated tremulously.</p>

<p>A look of pain came to his face.</p>

<p>“Did I dream my tree?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried, “no, dear. You did have your
tree. Mother told you yesterday was Christmas because
we could just have the tree that day—and she
wanted you to have all the fun—<i>all</i> of it, Tony—”
She broke down, and buried her face in his warm
neck.</p>

<p>Something of the solemnity and old wisdom born
in a child when a grown person apologizes, or explains,
or in any wise treats him as an equal, came
growing in Tony’s face. But this was over-shadowed
now, by a dawning joy.</p>

<p>“Mother!” he cried. “Truly? Truly, is it Christmas
<i>again</i>?”</p>

<p>“Not again,” she said. “But it’s Christmas.”</p>

<p>He sat up, and threw his arms about her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad—I’m glad!” he cried. “Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
Mother. Then <i>it wasn’t just the tree that made us
happy, was it</i>?”</p>

<p>She held him close. And as they sat in each other’s
arms, in the bare room, with no tree, no roses, and
even the clay for a moment forgotten, there came
overwhelmingly to the woman, and dimly to the
child, the precious understanding that Christmas is
a spirit. And the spirit was with them, and made a
third presence in their sudden, indefinable joyousness.</p>

<p>Tony drew a little away, and laughed up at her.</p>

<p>“Mother Margaret!” he cried. “It’s Christmas—it’s
Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “yes, dear. Don’t you hear the
bells?”</p>

<p>Tony shook his head. “We don’t need the bells,
Mother,” he said. “Why, Mother Margaret!” he
cried, “maybe now we can get the feeling every
day!”</p>

<p class="c large sp"><i>Julia Burket</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Snyge</span>, the woodsman, walked briskly through the
gates of the park which surrounded the royal palace.
On his arm hung a small basket covered with a
white cloth. In the basket were some cranberry tarts
which his wife was sending to her aunt, an old
woman who stirred the royal soup-kettle.</p>

<p>As Snyge walked along the winding road the sun
shone and sparkled brightly on the snow; and the
roofs of the palace, which glistened through the tree-tops,
did not seem nearly so awe-inspiring as they
did on other days. On approaching the rear of the
palace he heard a great deal of loud hammering,
which sounded odd on the quiet of the winter afternoon.
He hastened his steps and opened the door
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Along one side of the brick-floored room there
stretched a long wooden table. Before the table was
a settle, and on this were seated a scullery-maid,
two butlers, four maids, and three small footmen;
all dressed in the olive livery of the king’s household
and all busily cracking nuts.</p>

<p>They made such a racket and commotion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
Snyge was obliged to walk the entire length of the
room before he could attract the attention of Mother
Jorgan, who was stirring away at the soup with
her back to the door.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of all this noise?” he
shouted in the old woman’s ear.</p>

<p>At the unexpected sound of his voice she gave a
start, and would have dropped the pot-stick if a
little boy, who was seated on a high stool behind the
kettle, had not caught it.</p>

<p>After Mother Jorgan had recovered from her surprise
she told the woodsman that they were cracking
nuts for the Christmas feast. They should all
have been done the day before, but the scullery-maid
had forgotten and the baker was now mixing up the
fruit-cake; so they had been forced to set every one
to work who was not already busy, in order that the
nuts should be ready in time.</p>

<p>While Mother Jorgan was muttering away in her
shrill, cackling voice, Snyge had been staring ahead
of him at the small boy on the stool. There was
really no reason why any one should look at poor
little Bebelle. He was by far the ugliest and most
insignificant-looking person in the room. Hunched
up on his stool in the dark shadows behind the kettle,
he looked more like some odious goblin than a little
boy. His thick black hair made a fitting frame for his
pinched face. His nose was long and crooked; his
eyes were very large and very black; and his pathetic
little mouth, although tender and childish,
made his face seem all the homelier by contrast. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
his hand he held a stick upon which, with infinite
labor, he was carving something.</p>

<p>However, Snyge, who said little, but saw a great
deal, when Mother Jorgan had finished, pointed his
finger at him and said, “Who is that?”</p>

<p>“I am Bebelle,” said the child in a thin, but
rather sweet, voice.</p>

<p>“And what is that you have there in your hand?”</p>

<p>“That,” said the old woman, “is the scepter he is
making for the king’s Christmas present.” And turning
her back to the kettle, she looked significantly
at Snyge and tapped her forehead. “Tell Snyge
about your present, Bebelle, and perhaps he will
give you a better stick of wood.”</p>

<p>But the child held the stick close and answered
fearfully: “Oh, no, thank you, Mother Jorgan! No,
thank you! this will do very well for what I want.
But I will tell the man what I know of it.”</p>

<p>At these words one of the small footmen, who
had stopped swinging his hammer for a moment in
order to eat a walnut, nudged his neighbor, and they
both picked up their bowls of nuts and squatted
down on the floor in front of the kettle. And the maid
who dusted the royal throne, and was just then going
through the kitchen, saw the pages and joined
the little group.</p>

<p>“We will now have some fun,” one of them whispered
to her.</p>

<p>Bebelle, who was unaware of his audience on the
other side of the kettle, turning towards Snyge, began
his tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“You see,” he said, “although I am lame and
stupid and of no use to any one, the good king allows
me to stay here in his kitchen. I sit here all
day behind the kettle; and when Mother Jorgan has
something else she must do, she allows me to stir
the soup. Each day I have a crust of bread and
bowl of froth from the top of the soup, and at night
the baker allows me to lie behind the great oven.
You see, I should be happy, for I have done nothing
to deserve this easy lot. But sometimes I am very
discontented. I was feeling that way one evening,
and, as I was alone in the kitchen, I climbed up there
on the table to look out of the casement. It was a
lovely night, with all the stars shining, and as I stood
there thinking how ashamed I should be to be unhappy
when so much splendor was about me, I saw
before me a beautiful hand reaching up on the other
side of the sill. It clasped a stick of wood and a piece
of paper. The hand laid them on the window-ledge,
and I heard a voice like music say, “These are for
you, Bebelle.’”</p>

<p>Here there was a great nudging and giggling on
the part of his unseen audience, and the little maid
called out, “Where is the paper now?”</p>

<p>Bebelle leaned far out over the kettle, and, seeing
the maid’s duster on the floor, turned again to Snyge
and said: “They often come to hear me tell about
it. The paper blew into the fire,” he explained, and
went on: “I was very much frightened and wanted
to climb down from the window and leave them there,
but at last I found courage to look at the paper. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
it were these words: <i>Justice, Mercy, Verity, Lowliness,
Devotion, Patience, Courage, and, above all,
Love</i>. I stood there a long time, and at last I thought
how fine it would be to make a new scepter for a
Christmas present to the king, and to carve these
words upon it. They are pretty words and have a
pleasant sound. I have never heard the wonderful
voice again, but I feel that this is what it would have
me do.”</p>

<p>“Now tell about how the words come,” demanded
one of the footmen.</p>

<p>But Bebelle would only say, “I am at the end of
‘<i>Patience</i>’ now, and, if you do not mind, I will start
to carve again. You see, there is very little time left
until Christmas.”</p>

<p>As Bebelle concluded, his small audience broke up.
The maid returned to her dusting, the footmen took
their bowls and hammers back to the table, and
Mother Jorgan, giving the pot-stick to little Bebelle,
went to the door with Snyge.</p>

<p>With the return of the footmen, the noise was
even more deafening than before. The fruit-cake was
all mixed but the nuts, and the baker stood over the
small regiment of workers, every now and then rapping
up some lagging one with a cuff on the ears.
Mother Jorgan was obliged fairly to shriek the rest
of the conversation; or rather her part of it, for
Snyge said very little.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true. Bebelle has been carving at the
old stick for weeks. He is very happy. But he is a
stupid dolt. The king does not even know that he lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
here in the kitchen. If he did, it would all be at an end
with little Bebelle.”</p>

<p>“And about the hand?” asked the woodsman.</p>

<p>“That? Oh, well, I don’t know. No one here believes
it. But I couldn’t say. It may be. But I know
this much: I have seen the words come. When he
was at ‘<i>Mercy</i>,’ a few weeks ago, one of the huntsmen
brought him a little half-dead squirrel for his
supper. But the foolish child warmed it and set it
free. When he went back to his carving, ‘Mercy’
was there on the stick. That has been the way with
them all. I know, for I have seen it with my sharp old
eyes.”</p>

<p>Snyge gave her the basket and went out into the
dusk. He had stayed long past his time.</p>

<p>In a little while the noise in the kitchen ceased.
The nuts were all finished and put in the waiting
cake, and the room was quiet but for the crackling
of the fire and the chatter of the servants.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Patience</i>’ is very hard,” said little Bebelle to
Mother Jorgan. “I get along very well for a while,
but just as I have almost finished, the letters seem
to fly back again. It is very funny.</p>

<p>“Listen, Mother Jorgan! Some one is coming. It
is Shreve of the Fields.” His face was lit up until
it seemed almost pretty, and his hands trembled at
his carving.</p>

<p>In a moment there was a low, mysterious bird-note.
Some one drew back the bolts, and youth incarnate
stood framed in the dark oaken doorway.
Shreve of the Fields swayed there, his slim, vibrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
figure outlined against the sparkling snow without.
Pushed back from his thick dark curls he wore a
bag-like cap of brilliant red. Over the shoulder of his
tattered jacket was flung a brown sack, and in his
hands he held a torn net. The lovely poise of his
proud young head, the startling beauty of his face,
the wonder of his gay, mysterious eyes, were all so
intense that one looked again and again, awed,
troubled, stupefied, unable to understand such glorious
beauty. It was like some vague lovely dream
that one had been forced by the very intensity of its
sweetness to cast from his thoughts, now recurring
to the mind. Even the servants felt it, and they
looked again and again at the not unfamiliar sight
of the radiant youth. And Shreve, unable, as always,
to understand this blind desire to pierce the
mystery of his beauty, crossed the room with swift,
free steps and approached Bebelle.</p>

<p>“I have brought you this net to mend,” he said,
and his voice was low and wonderfully sweet. “I use
it to catch the poor starving hares; and then I feed
them. I will wait if you are not too long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do it gladly,” responded the child; “and
I’ll try to hasten as much as I can.”</p>

<p>He put the unfinished scepter in his threadbare
little blouse, and bent carefully over the net.</p>

<p>It had now grown dark, and one of the pages went
about the room with a taper lighting the candles in
the greater pewter sticks. One by one the butlers
and footmen came in to eat their evening meal before
they should serve the royal dinner. All was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
light, and laughter and good-natured raillery in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Shreve walked restlessly up and down the long
room. Each time he passed the oven he would snatch
a loaf and put it in his sack. “For my birds,” he
would say with his dazzling smile to the baker. Each
time he neared the soup-kettle he stopped and
watched little Bebelle’s swift-moving fingers. Without
looking up, the child would answer his unspoken
question, “In a little while, Shreve, I shall have
finished it.”</p>

<p>As the graceful, glowing figure moved about the
room all the youths stared at him and the maidens
glanced more shyly from under their long lashes.
But Shreve’s thoughts were on the world outside
and the mending of the net. However, when they
spoke to him, he always answered sweetly in his
lovely, winning voice.</p>

<p>“How are your friends, O Shreve?” said Mother
Jorgan.</p>

<p>“They are well. Only it is cold in the mountains,
and the beasts freeze; and the woods and fields are
bare, so my birds want food. But wait, old woman;
some day I shall know all of nature’s secrets, and
then winter cannot harm my people.”</p>

<p>The servants now came up to the kettle to get
their bowls of soup, and Shreve of the Fields stood
in the corner and watched them silently.</p>

<p>At last Bebelle crept down from his stool, and
slowly moved toward Shreve.</p>

<p>“Here is your net, Shreve,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>The beautiful youth took the net and held it before
him. He tugged at it, but the mended threads
held as firmly as the others.</p>

<p>“This is nicely done, Bebelle. When I come at
Christmas I will bring you some fairy moss. How is
your scepter?” he asked a little shyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is almost finished. I am on ‘<i>Patience</i>’
now.”</p>

<p>Bebelle pulled the stick from his blouse, and as
Shreve of the Fields bent over it, he saw that “<i>Patience</i>”
was finished.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>It was the eve of Christmas, and all the great
castle was in a merry bustle and a wild confusion.
From the little scullery-maid, who was giving the
pots and pans a final scouring, to the queen herself,
who was being fitted with a new crown, not a soul
in the palace was idle.</p>

<p>The great hall was all green, and red, and white;
pine, and holly, and mistletoe. The white pillars
were twined with ivy and laurel; from the rafters
hung great clusters of mistletoe; and the walls were
banked with leaves and red berries. On each side
of the royal dais stood a shining, glistening
Christmas-tree; and the galleries were hung low
with Christmas greens.</p>

<p>It was not long until the king and queen ascended
their royal thrones, the queen happy because the
new crown was very becoming, and the king that
there was a grand feast in prospect.</p>

<p>The royal court assembled with laughter and gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
words and smiling faces; and of them all the princess
Faunia was the most admired. Tall and slim
and beautiful, as the princess should be, with the
dainty grace of a young fawn and the proud young
way of one, she stood by the dais with a dark, handsome
prince. Each time he spoke to her, although
his words were laughing, she knew that he loved
her; and each time he looked at her, his gay eyes
said what his lips dared not speak. The princess, like
every one else in the room, was very, very happy.</p>

<p>In the kitchen below sat Bebelle, carving the last
word upon his gift for the king. His face was very
pale; it looked even thinner than usual. His great
black eyes burned feverishly, and his hands worked
swiftly upon the word “<i>Love</i>.”</p>

<p>“I must not be late! I must not be late!” he said
over and over again.</p>

<p>Most of the servants had left the kitchen and were
sitting in the gallery of the hall above, watching the
royal pageant.</p>

<p>However, there was a little girl left in the room,
who had to remain behind in order to keep the fire
going in the great fireplace.</p>

<p>“When will you give the king his gift?” she asked
Bebelle.</p>

<p>“When all the others have given theirs and Shreve
of the Fields alone is left he will give the king his
beautiful raven, and then he will say, ‘There is still
another, O King, who has a gift for you.’ Mother
Jorgan has promised to let me go with her up
the stairs, and when Shreve says this, then I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
walk into the room and give the king his scepter.”</p>

<p>“Shreve of the Fields may forget,” said the little
girl, shrewdly; “he thinks only of his birds and
beasts, of others he has no thought. Old Jason, the
butler, says he has no soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he has!” said Bebelle. “He is wild and
timid like his animals, though, and is afraid to show
it. He has told me how some nights he lies in his
cave with his animals and longs for a human friend.
But you know, Sana, he is so beautiful and so different
from every one else that no one can be friends
with him. But look what he gave me! It is fairy
moss, and Shreve says that if I carry it, I shall
be brave enough to walk through the great hall to
the king and not be ashamed of my ugly face.</p>

<p>Bebelle held up a little patch of silvery moss,
the drops of dew sparkling like diamonds upon it.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the child, in awed wonder. “It is so
beautiful! And do you think it really has such
power?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course; Shreve told me so.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” sighed little Sana, “if I only had a tiny
bit, I would not be so afraid of the butler when he
scolds me.”</p>

<p>Bebelle carefully tore the moss in half and gave
Sana part of it.</p>

<p>“I must go back to my carving now,” he said, as
the child tried to thank him.</p>

<p>“And I to my fire. Oh, Bebelle! Look! Look!”
cried Sana. “The fire has gone out while I have been
talking to you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“I will make you another.”</p>

<p>When Mother Jorgan came in, the fire was again
burning brightly.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, Bebelle?” she asked, her voice
trembling with excitement. “Shreve is giving the
king his raven.”</p>

<p>“No, dear Mother Jorgan, I have mended the fire
for Sana instead.”</p>

<p>“You foolish boy!” and she tore the stick from
his hand. “Why, of course it is done! Is ‘<i>Love</i>’ not
there as plainly as the other words? Come, we must
make haste or we shall be too late.”</p>

<p>As the two reached the door of the hall Shreve
of the Fields was standing before the royal dais,
his proud lovely head thrown back and one graceful
arm stretched forth toward the king. On the tip
of his finger there perched a beautiful raven, all
glossy black streaked with purple, and as quiet as
if it were still in the forest. As these two of the
woods stood there in their perfect, unaffected beauty
everything else about the gay court seemed curiously
dwarfed and cheapened.</p>

<p>“O King,” he said, in his sweet, thrilling voice,
“here is a gift for you!”</p>

<p>As the raven flew from his hand to the king the
courtiers crowded around the radiant youth; and
Mother Jorgan, in the doorway outside, whispered
to Bebelle: “Child, he has said nothing of you. If
you still wish to do this dreadful thing, you must
enter unannounced.”</p>

<p>And so, with his scepter held closely in one arm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
the child bravely walked into the gay throng.</p>

<p>As he neared the throne the courtiers drew back
on either side; and standing before the royal dais,
Bebelle said simply, “My King, I have made you
a new scepter for a Christmas gift.”</p>

<p>All about the throne lay precious and costly gifts;
gold and tapestries, silver and precious stones. On
the arm of the king’s chair perched the beautiful
raven, and in the queen’s hand was a necklace of
diamonds, and rare aquamarines. Before them stood
a child, strange and grotesque, holding in his hand
a rough piece of fire-wood.</p>

<p>“I have made you a new scepter,” he had said.</p>

<p>“Child,” said the king, and his voice was not unkind,
“this is not the time for you to appear before
us.” And he motioned a page to lead Bebelle from
the room.</p>

<p>There was a painful silence as the child crept
slowly from the bright hall, one hand still clasping
the rejected gift. The queen signed for the fiddlers
to begin their playing. The princess Faunia, who
was standing with the noble prince under the balcony,
remarked that such things were enough to
spoil one’s Christmas. The prince comforted her,
and said if he had his will, nothing should ever happen
to mar a single moment of her entire life. The
princess was even happier than before. The queen
told the king, who looked a little worried, that such
things naturally happen in such great households,
and that, with the serving of the royal banquet,
things would be restored to their former gaiety.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
This last suggestion comforted the king mightily;
and, indeed, before the page had even announced the
banquet everything was as gay and merry as it had
been an hour before.</p>

<p>In the bright warm kitchen there was dance and
song, and every one there was happy, too.</p>

<p>That is, all but little Bebelle. He lay beside the
oven, still holding tightly to the scepter, saying
nothing.</p>

<p>Mother Jorgan brought him a bowl of hot soup.
He thanked her pitifully, but would not touch it.
Now and then one of the servants would come to
him and shyly, but kindly, ask him to come and have
some of the wassail. Shreve came down from the
feast above. The baker gave him thirteen loaves for
his birds, and he stopped to speak to Bebelle.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Bebelle,” he said, in his timid, winning
way. “But I had no chance to speak of you.
It was a shame that the king refused your gift. But
come, do not be sad. Every one is sorry, and things
will not be made better by lying there.”</p>

<p>But Bebelle did not answer. The tears sprang to
Shreve’s beautiful, mysterious eyes.</p>

<p>“Would you like to come and sleep in my cave
to-night?”</p>

<p>Bebelle gave a little gasp.</p>

<p>“Oh, Shreve,” he said, “that is the greatest thing
in the world that could happen to me! But somehow
I feel as if that could not be—to-night.”</p>

<p>So Shreve of the Fields went a little sadly out into
the starry night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>It grew later. Slowly and reluctantly the servants
left the warm, friendly kitchen. Many stopped to
speak kindly to the silent child, who lay huddled in
his corner.</p>

<p>At last, though, they had all left but a little page,
who put out the candles and skipped fearfully from
the room. All was silent and dark.</p>

<p>The child lay there a long time.</p>

<p>Slowly and sweetly, through the still night a voice
softly floated.</p>

<p>“Bebelle, little Bebelle!” it said; “come to the
door.”</p>

<p>The child trembled, but did not get up.</p>

<p>Once again came the low, mellow voice: “Bebelle,
I am waiting for you. Come, open the door.”</p>

<p>As if in a dream he crept across the floor. Slowly
he slid back the great bolts and lifted the door latch.</p>

<p>There in the snowy dooryard was a glorious vision.
A figure that glowed and glistened against the
snow like the fire and light of a thousand diamonds.
Over the head was a veil like lacy frost. From the
scintillating robes stretched a beautiful white hand.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said the voice, “and I will make
you a great ruler.”</p>

<p>Bebelle shrank back against the heavy door.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” he cried, “I am not fit to be a ruler.
I am ugly and poor, and of no use to any one in the
world.”</p>

<p>The vision reached out and took the scepter which
Bebelle still clasped to his breast.</p>

<p>As the firm white hand grasped it the rough wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
turned to shining gold and the letters carved upon
it were set with pearls, and rubies, and sapphires,
and other precious stones.</p>

<p>“These words that you have carved upon the
scepter,” said the high, thrilling voice, “<i>Justice,
Mercy, Verity, Lowliness, Devotion, Patience, Courage,
and, above all, Love</i>—these are the attributes of
a king. Only he who carves his own scepter, with
these words upon it, only he is fit to wield it. Again
I summon you to come with me and I will make
you ruler of a great kingdom.”</p>

<p>And into the white night the child followed the
steps of the vision.</p>

MR. BEAR<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></h2>

<p class="c large sp"><span class="smcap">The Christmas Tree</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bear</span> was looking forward to the first real snowstorm
because Mr. Dog had made a fine double-runner,
and they were both planning for little
housework, and a lot of coasting. Mr. Bear’s fur suit
was just the thing for winter sports, but Mr. Dog
had been obliged to go to the village and buy himself
a sweater. It was bright crimson and was very
becoming. Mr. Dog, who loved fine clothes, had also
purchased a scarlet and white skating cap, with
a tassel that hung down over one ear in a most
engaging manner. So both Mr. Dog and Mr. Bear
could hardly wait for cold weather to set in, and they
spent a great deal of time running out to the porch
and looking at the thermometer that hung there.
When they were not doing that, they were reading
the weather reports in the newspapers, or watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
the clouds, and at last they were rewarded late one
afternoon by the sight of large feathery flakes of
snow lazily floating downward from a cold gray
sky. But alas! there was to be no coasting for either
of them, for many days to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Bear, who had not been feeling like himself
for some time, came down with the mumps the very
next morning, and Mr. Dog had his paws full with
cooking, and nursing, and bedmaking, and carrying
up trays to the invalid.</p>

<p>Now I suppose you never saw a bear with the
mumps! It is a sorry sight, I assure you, and the
cottage was a sad place now with only the doctor’s
visits for company and Mr. Bear in the dreadfulest
state with his poor neck so swollen that none
of his collars would fit him—he had lately, to please
Mr. Dog, taken to wearing them. For daily use a
red bandana handkerchief became the only thing
possible. Well, Mr. Dog was a pretty fair nurse,
though he did bring Mr. Bear some lemonade the
first day, and, if you’ve ever had mumps, you will
know how Mr. Bear felt after he got a real good
taste. But Mr. Dog was more careful after that
and never so much as said “pickles” or brought Mr.
Bear anything that was sour or puckery, so they
got along quite nicely.</p>

<p>Still, there was a lot of time for thinking, and Mr.
Bear, looking wistfully out on the snowy landscape,
began to plan for Christmas. He decided that he
would surprise Mr. Dog, and the surprise would
take the form of a Christmas tree. There were plenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
of dear little firs growing about near by, each one
holding up its tiny branches as if begging for the
honor of being chosen, and Mr. Bear knew Mr. Dog,
who was something of a carpenter, was just dying
to have a complete tool-chest, and he thought what
a fine present that would be and how beautifully the
awl and saws and other tools would glitter, hung
from the branches in the light of the Christmas
candles.</p>

<p>Mr. Bear would also see that Mr. Dog had a wonderful
big bone, the best in the market, and tied
with scarlet ribbon and holly, and a bottle of perfumery,
and oh, yes! a dozen handkerchiefs with
colored borders. Mr. Bear had to get his notebook
down and write the things as fast as he remembered
them, and the best of it was Mr. Bear was determined,
firmly determined, that Mr. Dog should know
nothing whatever about the whole matter.</p>

<p>Now the funny part of it was that Mr. Dog had
been thinking also, and the end of his reflections
were pretty much what Mr. Bear’s had been. He
would give Mr. Bear a Christmas tree and <i>Mr. Bear
should know nothing whatever about it</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Dog was so excited that one day he put salt
instead of sugar into the pudding and never knew
the difference till he and Mr. Bear sat down to dessert
together. By this time Mr. Bear was better,
and soon he was well enough to go coasting, which
means that he was well enough to do anything at all
that he wanted to.</p>

<p>His actions began to puzzle Mr. Dog. In the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
place, Mr. Bear began to make a lot of mysterious
trips to the village, and then he was always getting a
lot of catalogues, which he was careful to keep locked
up. One day Mr. Dog found him measuring the
height of the parlor ceiling, and he looked very much
embarrassed when asked what he was doing; and
yet Mr. Dog hadn’t the slightest idea of what was
going on. You see, he was so full of his own plans
to surprise Mr. Bear that it never crossed his mind
that Mr. Bear might have secret holiday plans of
his own. Mr. Dog was chiefly concerned that Mr.
Bear shouldn’t find out what <i>he</i> was doing, and, as
he was much more careful than poor, dear, blundering
Mr. Bear, he never gave his friend the slightest
idea of what was in his mind.</p>

<p>After a lot of thinking, Mr. Dog decided to cut
the prettiest little Christmas tree you ever saw, that
he had found near by in the forest. He would trim
it with popcorn and cranberries and little candles,
and he would give Mr. Bear a half dozen jars of
the finest honey, because Mr. Bear loved honey best
of anything, and a big blueberry pie tied up with
scarlet ribbon and holly, for Mr. Bear liked blueberry
pie next best, and a muffler, a beautiful warm
plaid muffler, because Mr. Bear wasn’t stylish but
loved to be comfortable. Oh, yes, and a white and
gold book for the parlor table. Mr. Dog didn’t care
at all what was inside the book, but he wanted a very
handsome cover. It would look awfully well under
the best lamp, and as the only book in the house was
a cook-book, Mr. Dog felt it would lend quite an air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
to the whole cottage, and was, in a way, really
needed. To do all this would take every penny Mr.
Dog had earned, but Mr. Dog did not grudge a single
cent of his hoard.</p>

<p>Mr. Bear didn’t tell anybody of his plan, and Mr.
Dog didn’t tell anybody either. They both gave
very good reasons for refusing a number of invitations
that they received for Christmas parties; Mr.
Bear, looking very wise, said he felt rather old for
romping about, just a quiet evening in slippers at
home for him; and Mr. Dog said what with the
mumps and all he was so behindhand with his work
that he thought he would rather spend a quiet day
at home, with slippers and a comfortable chair before
the fire in the evening.</p>

<p>But what were they going to do about Christmas,
their friends asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Bear looked up in the air and rubbed his head
and finally said something about wreaths in the
windows, and Mr. Dog answered briskly that he was
going to make the finest plum pudding that day for
dinner they ever saw and if that wasn’t celebrating
Christmas, what was?</p>

<p>Still, it did seem as if the time would never arrive,
for you know yourself how slow Christmas and
birthdays and vacations are about getting around;
and how very quickly school-days and trips to the
dentist, and such things come. But at last it really
was December twenty-fourth, and that very evening
after sunset had been planned both by Mr. Dog and
Mr. Bear for their grand surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Dog had all his presents on the top shelf of
his bedroom closet, and Mr. Bear had all his presents
on the top shelf of <i>his</i> bedroom closet: and both
of them had their closets locked and the keys in their
pockets.</p>

<p>Neither of the friends talked much at supper that
night for both were too busy thinking. Mr. Bear
wanted to get some good excuse for leaving Mr. Dog
and getting into the forest where the Christmas tree
was to be found. It was already cut, but it wanted
trimming, and Mr. Bear decided to trim it right
where it stood, or rather where it leaned against
another fir-tree, and then manage some way to get
it into the house without Mr. Dog’s knowing it. Mr.
Bear’s pockets were full of tinsel and bells, gilt
walnuts, golden and silver balls, and such like ornaments.
He fairly tinkled when he walked; but
Mr. Dog was so very busy thinking that he didn’t
notice.</p>

<p>At last supper was over and the dishes neatly
washed and put away. The two friends turned to
each other, and both spoke at once and said just the
same thing all in a breath without pausing:</p>

<p>“I was thinking of taking a little stroll this evening.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s a good idea,” said Mr. Bear, putting
on his cap and goloshes as he spoke. It was
handy for him not having to bother with anything
more on account of his fine fur coat, though he would
rather have liked a muffler.</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” said Mr. Dog, hurriedly getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
into his coasting togs—sweater, tasseled cap, and
all.</p>

<p>“Which way were you going, Mr. Bear? I was
thinking of going west—”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of going east,” said Mr. Bear,
much relieved at the turn things were taking. And
so the two friends parted.</p>

<p>Mr. Bear called out over his shoulder, “No use,
Mr. Dog, of being back before eight o’clock a fine
night like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Mr. Dog, much pleased and inwardly
planning to get his tree trimmed in the forest,
and then to have it all set up in the cottage a
few moments before that hour.</p>

<p>So both friends hurried off—Mr. Dog to the west,
to hang on his tree as fast as ever he could the
strings of cranberries and pop-corn with which his
pockets were bulging, and Mr. Bear to decorate his
tree in the most beautiful manner and as rapidly
as possible. And my! weren’t they busy? You may
not believe it, but each of them got through the very
same moment, which was exactly seventeen and a
half minutes to eight o’clock, and each of them was
exactly one half mile from home. Mr. Bear put his
tree on his shoulder and started; Mr. Dog put <i>his</i>
tree on <i>his</i> shoulder and started. Mr. Bear’s tree
was bigger and heavier than Mr. Dog’s tree, but
then Mr. Bear was stronger than Mr. Dog, so they
both covered the ground at the same rate of speed.</p>

<p>Now I suppose you have already guessed what
happened. It was sure to, wasn’t it? And it just did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Dog, stealthily coming up the back way, and
Mr. Bear, stealthily coming up the front way, met
right at the cottage door, and I wish you had been
there to see them. I don’t suppose their eyes were
ever wider opened in all their lives; and as for their
mouths, they were open too, and both their tongues
were hanging out.</p>

<p>Mr. Dog was the quickest, so he began to laugh
first, but Mr. Bear was not long in following, and
they both laughed so hard they had to lean their
beautiful Christmas trees up against the side of the
cottage while they rolled over and over in the snow
and neither one could stop.</p>

<p>But at last Mr. Bear caught his breath and sat
up, and Mr. Dog, still wiping away tears of merriment
with his paw, sat up too, and then it all came
out—their wonderful plans and all the doings.</p>

<p>Well, the end of it was, there were two Christmas
trees set up in Mr. Bear’s house that night and two
very happy people.</p>

<p>The presents were truly a surprise after all, and
they were exactly right. Each said so to the other,
I don’t know how many times. Mr. Bear put on his
muffler at once, though the cottage was as hot as hot
could be, and Mr. Dog had so much perfumery on
his handkerchief that they had to open the front
door to air off. Mr. Dog began to do things with his
tools at once, while gnawing ever and anon at his
wonderful bone, and Mr. Bear ate a piece of blueberry
pie that was big enough to give him seven
kinds of nightmare, but didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>Then Mr. Bear drew up his big rocking-chair to the
fire, while Mr. Dog threw himself down on the rug
in front of it and stretched out to enjoy the blaze
with his paws clasped under his head. And they both
said there had never been such a Christmas and that
it was the greatest fun having it that way, all alone.
I suppose they meant not having the forest and the
farm people there; and perhaps this is a good place
and time for you and me to leave them, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Culberson</span> stood in her cabin door, and looked
out upon the sparkling beauty of a sunny winter
morning. Beyond the valley rose the shining, snow-covered
mountains. A mile below lay the white surface
of Henry’s Fork, tree-bordered and ice-bound.
She could see the exact spot in the stream where
she and the children had caught the barrel of suckers
that had been their chief food since the snow
came.</p>

<p>When Henry Clay, her oldest child and only son,
had come from the creek one day and told her that
there were a great many fish at the bend, and that
they were lying on the bottom almost too lazy to
move, she had said, “We’ll go and catch a lot; we
will salt them down in our water keg; they’ll come in
handy.” That had been almost four months before.</p>

<p>“Pa” Culberson was one of those Micawber-like
persons who are always expecting something to turn
up. In more prosperous days, when the Culbersons
had lived farther east, they had owned a good team<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
of horses and a cow; but Pa’s waiting propensities
had encouraged the man with the mortgage to “turn
up,” and the family had been left without their
horses and their cow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Culberson had urged her husband to sell
their little plot of land and to use the proceeds to
begin anew in another place. Pa had a “swapping”
streak in him, and so it was not long before they
had traded their land for a rickety wagon and a pair
of small beasts that Mrs. Culberson called “dunkeys.”
Then, with all they owned piled into the
wagon, they set forth to make a fresh start in the
world. Pa sat on the top of the load to drive the donkeys,
and Mrs. Culberson and the children walked
alongside.</p>

<p>One night they had camped by a stream in a fertile
little valley. Mrs. Culberson liked the water and
the view, and refused to go on. Weeks of wandering
had worn out the children’s shoes, and winter would
soon be upon them; so they unloaded their scanty
belongings and set about building their cabin. It
stood close to a hillside for shelter from the fierce
winds, and it had no floor except the earth. A place
had been left for a window in one end, but there was
no glass in it. A piece of cheesecloth tacked over the
opening let in light and a wooden shutter kept out
the storm. The roof was made of poles laid carefully
side by side and well covered with earth.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Culberson and the children were chinking
and daubing the cracks in their cabin, Pa began
to build the stable for the donkeys. The golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
September days were slipping away, and the food
supply was getting low; as soon as he had finished
the tiny stable, Pa went off to get work with the
sheepmen. The family were left alone in their new
house; it might be months before they saw him
again; in fact, it might be as long as that before
they saw anyone except “Grandma” Clark, who
lived in a cabin near the stream.</p>

<p>Every day little Mrs. Culberson worked with all
her might; and in order that the children should not
get lonely or afraid in the wilderness, she tried to
keep them busy. First she set them hauling wood
from the cedars near by; Pa had made a door for the
cabin from the wagon box, but they could load the
wood and poles on the running gear of their wagon.
They could manage the donkeys easily, and they
soon gathered a huge woodpile. Then the children
dug a cellar in the side of the hill. Henry Clay and
Lizzie Isabel, who were the oldest, did the digging.
Jennie Lou and Jessie May helped by carrying out
the dirt as fast as it was loosened. Mrs. Culberson
and five-year-old baby C’listie did the encouraging.
Each was proud of sharing in the work.</p>

<p>A few days after the cellar was finished, the children
went on an exploring expedition to discover
whether they had any neighbors. The first rancher
they found laughed when he saw the eager, freckled
children on their little donkeys. He was harvesting
his vegetables, and he offered them all a chance to
work for him. After that, the children and their
mother were busy for almost a month, picking up potatoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
and helping store winter vegetables for the
ranchers who lived up and down the valley. In that
way they had stocked their own cellar, and had become
the proud owners of a few bags of grain, which
they put by for their faithful donkeys.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Culberson stood in the door that winter
morning, looking out over the snow-covered country,
she was mentally giving thanks that she and
the children had a warm cabin to shelter them. On
a tall, dead pine she saw a great eagle sitting in
the sun. A coyote dug a rabbit out of the snow, and
trotted away with it. Far below on the creek, she
could see the smoke curling upward from her nearest
neighbor’s chimney.</p>

<p>“Poor old soul!” she said to herself. “There all
alone while her grandson, Charley, is away herding
sheep. It must be plumb bad to have only one child,
and to be a widow, and old, too. Here it is just two
days before Christmas. I believe I’ll go down and
bring her up here for a spell.”</p>

<p>Her care-seamed face was thoughtful. “It’s
more’n three months since Pa left, and not a word
from him. I <i>do</i> hope he hasn’t—”</p>

<p>But she was too loyal to put what she feared into
words, even to herself. Closing the door, she put the
breakfast of salt fish and potatoes on the table.</p>

<p>“Ma, can’t we have a little <i>tiny</i> piece of bacon for
breakfast?” asked Jennie Lou.</p>

<p>“It’s very near Christmas,” said Jessie May.</p>

<p>“I just hate suckers!” said Lizzie Isabel.</p>

<p>“Now you young uns eat what is put before you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
and don’t be so choicey,” said Mrs. Culberson. “I
declare, I’ll have to boil you up some sage tea to
make your fish and potatoes taste good to you again.
Then after we’re through, I have a <i>big</i> secret to tell
you.”</p>

<p>The wagon box had furnished enough lumber to
make not only the door, but a bench, and a high
shelf across one end of the cabin. When the children
had finished breakfast, their mother put a box upon
the bench. Mounting the box, she took from the shelf
several small packages.</p>

<p>“Now, children,” she said, as she unrolled a
square package, “here is all the meat we have—just
enough for seven slices. We are going to have
it for dinner Christmas Day, and <i>who</i> do you guess
is going to eat the extra slice? <i>That</i> is my big secret.”</p>

<p>“I could eat <i>all</i> of it now,” said Henry Clay. The
children eyed the piece of bacon hungrily.</p>

<p>“Children, what on earth has come over you to
make you so gluttonous? I am ashamed of you. Now,
if you can behave yourselves, I will tell you something.”</p>

<p>They watched her with fascinated eyes as she
measured two cupfuls of sugar into a small pail.
Next she took four tablespoonfuls of rice, carefully
tied the little heap of white grains in a cloth, and
dropped it into the pail with the sugar. Putting the
lid on the pail, she again mounted the box, and put
the pail beside a small jar that contained a handful
of coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>“There,” she said, with pride in her voice, “that
is my sick corner. If any of you get sick, I have <i>some</i>
little things for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sick, I’m awfully sick,” said C’listie.</p>

<p>“C’listie Culberson, no one would ever dream you
were named for your own grandmother, C’listie
Yancy. Your Grandma Yancy would <i>never</i> act that
way.”</p>

<p>The children watched her intently and silently as
she measured the remaining sugar.</p>

<p>“There is enough for a cake, and we can have a
carrot pie,” she said, “and perhaps some sugar
syrup for breakfast, and there will be a little left
in the bowl. Don’t one of you young uns dare to
touch that bowl; the sugar in the bowl is for manners;
now mind that. We’ll have a nice dish of rice,
and enough grease will fry out of the bacon to season
the potatoes and to make the pie crust, and we
can have biscuit, too,” she ended triumphantly.</p>

<p>The children, catching her jubilant spirit, began
to clap their hands and dance.</p>

<p>“Now, Lizzie Isabel, we will clean up the house and
get everything ready. You girls can wear your gingham
dresses, and Henry Clay can—well, he can wear
his pa’s light shirt, and his trousers, too; they will
be too long, of course, but he can roll them up, and
we can girt them in at the waist. We’ll all dress up
and go after Grandma Clark. She’s all alone. We
couldn’t be so selfish as to sit down and eat all our
good things alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>So they all worked with a will; but there was not
much to do.</p>

<p>“You children don’t know how lucky you are to
be poor,” said Mrs. Culberson. “If we’d been rich
enough to have a floor, we would have to scrub; and
if we had a glass window, we’d have that to wash.
But as it is, we can get this room in order in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p>Through all her ups and downs, Mrs. Culberson
had kept her “settin’ out”; she had her feather bed,
the ten beautiful patchwork quilts given her by different
members of her family; the Yancy sheets and
the lovely Culberson tablecloth, all homespun and
woven.</p>

<p>It was a proud little group that later in the day
left the freshly decked cabin and started for
Grandma Clark’s. All the girls’ dresses were a year
too small, their sleeves were too short and their
waists too tight; but the children had pressed their
worn ribbons, and their hair was neatly braided, and
they were all so happy that only an unfeeling critic
could have seen anything except beauty and sweetness
about them. Henry Clay’s trousers were many
sizes too large, but they were rolled up at the bottom
and well “girt in” at the waist. His shirt was caught
up and tacked and pinned in so many places that it
had almost lost all resemblance to a shirt; but
if his fourteen year old body <i>was</i> too small to fill
his father’s clothes, his pride overflowed, and made
him seem large and important in his own eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>They had laid poles upon the running gear of the
wagon and wired them firmly, in order to have a
safe place for Grandma Clark to ride. Mrs. Culberson
took a last satisfied look round the neat room,
warned the children once more to mind their manners,
and not to let the company see that they did
not have bread every meal, and to remember how
fortunate they were to have a good warm cabin,
plenty of wood, and friends to share their comforts,
“and them friends rale close neighbors, not more’n
six miles away.”</p>

<p>So they clambered on their odd carryall and
drove off, with the donkeys belly-deep in the soft
snow.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Miles away, up in the mountains near Burnt Fork,
lay the ranch of Jack Nevin. He was an “old-timer”
without kith or kin, but he never lived alone, for
he was always taking some one in to share his home.
At that time he had living with him old John Enderby,
who had a special fondness for making fun
of others. Once a year Jack Nevin made a trip to
Green River for supplies, but, oddly enough, he
would never permit anyone to go with him.</p>

<p>No one who came to the ranch suspected that
Jack’s heart was starved for home ties, and that he
longed for some one to love and to work for. For
years he had had an imaginary family. He took almost
as much pleasure in the growth and development
of his imaginary children as he would have
taken had they been real. Of course he could not tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
his friends about his pretense; but when he went to
town he spoke to strangers of his “folks,” and
talked about them just as if he had actually had a
family.</p>

<p>This was the first time he had ever been in Green
River when the holidays were so near. The windows
of the stores were filled with toys and candies. As
he drove up the street his heart was sad; there were
so many things that he would have liked to buy if
he had only had some one to give them to.</p>

<p>When he drove into the livery barn, the proprietor,
to whom he had talked on his other visits, called
out, “Hello, Nevin! How are you? How are the little
girls and their ma? In town to interview Santa
Claus, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Jack walked up the street, looking at the pretty
things, and almost hating other men who had
“folks” to buy for. Suddenly he remembered what
Hall, the liveryman, had said. After all, why should
he not do it? Whose business was it, anyway, if
he chose to buy dolls, toys, and trinkets? As he
thought over the idea his recklessness grew. The
boys might laugh and joke, he realized, but the
chance that they would find out seemed small.</p>

<p>That night he confided in his landlady; and his
enthusiasm for his family was so contagious that
she forgot the high price of meat.</p>

<p>“I suppose your little girls sent you loaded with a
list?” she said.</p>

<p>Jack searched his pockets, but failed to find any
list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s too bad,” he said, with such
evident concern that the landlady was entirely deceived.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you worry,” she said. “My Emma
works at Little Pete’s. You can get more for your
money in there than you can at any other store in
town. And Emma will help you make a good selection.”</p>

<p>The next morning the whim was still upon Jack
Nevin. He went to Little Pete’s, and passed there
the happiest three hours of his life, choosing and
buying the things that he would have liked to put
into little stockings.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll take that sweater for ma,” he said
awkwardly. After a while his fancy became more
practical, and he bought warm hoods, pieces of
flannel, gingham, and calico.</p>

<p>At last all the bundles were wrapped and loaded
on the wagon with the provisions that he had purchased
for the winter. Jack was standing in a store
entrance, trying to remember whether he had forgotten
anything, when up the street rode half a
dozen Burnt Fork boys, with their “chaps” flapping
and their spurs jangling merrily. They shouted a
greeting when they caught sight of Jack. Jack
watched them canter up the street with foreboding
in his heart.</p>

<p>It was already late in the afternoon, but he decided
to start on the return trip to his ranch immediately
for he did not enjoy the thought that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
“boys” might discover how he had been spending
his time in Green River.</p>

<p>Sunset of the following day saw him nearing
home, but trouble had sat with him all the way. He
could imagine what “fun” there would be at the
ranch if those boys found out his poor secret. What
could he do with all the things he had bought for
his imaginary family? If he took them home, there
was John Enderly to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>Finally a solution occurred to him—he would
throw them into Henry’s Fork. He knew where he
could find an air hole. By driving across the ice
below the regular crossing, he hoped to avoid discovery,
and so, leaving the road, he turned down
the long cañon that led out on the plateau on which
the Culberson cabin stood. When he came in sight
of the little log building he gave a whistle of surprise,
for he had not known that anyone lived there.
As he approached the cabin he hallooed, and getting
no answer, was about to drive on, when he noticed
that smoke was coming from the stove-pipe.</p>

<p>He decided to go in and warm his feet; but when
he entered the cabin, he found himself more interested
in the evidences of poverty than in the stove. A
box nailed to the wall served as a cupboard. He
lifted the flour-sack curtain before it, and peeped
within; he saw the bacon sliced for the Christmas
dinner; he saw all the scanty preparations.</p>

<p>“Huh!” he grunted. “Cake with no eggs! I’ve
made it; I know what it’s like!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>Dropping the curtain, he glanced about the room.
“No chairs,” he commented. “Must be mighty poor.
Kids in the bunch, too.” Then he noticed a cap hanging
on a peg. “Boy among ’em. By heck, I guess I’m
in time to beat Santy Claus, but I didn’t buy anything
for a boy.”</p>

<p>For an hour Jack worked busily and happily.
All that he had bought for his “family” he carried
into the cabin; then, opening cases of his own supplies,
he carried in canned goods, dried fruit, a
ham, some sugar, coffee, and a package of tea. When
he had finished, he gazed about the little room and
smiled. “Mighty near filled the cabin,” he said.
“Reckon some flour won’t be amiss, and I’ve a good
notion to fill that new lamp and leave it on the table,
lighted. They’re coming back soon, or they wouldn’t
have left fire. There’s the coat and the lamp for the
woman; candy, nuts and dolls for the kids; provisions
for ’em all, but not a thing for that boy.
I just can’t do him that way. He can have my new
gun.”</p>

<p>Jack went out to the wagon and brought in the
shotgun, and hanging the cap on the muzzle, leaned
it against the wall. Then he put his boxes of ammunition
on the floor beside it. Finally, he filled the
stove full of wood, and closing it carefully, left the
cabin.</p>

<p>The dusk was deepening when he mounted his
wagon. Beyond Henry’s Fork, he met the Culbersons
returning with their guest; he eyed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
sharply as they passed. After he had crossed the
bottoms and was out on the snow-covered flat, he
laughed happily.</p>

<p>“It beat throwing them into the creek,” he said,
“and the boy is just right for the gun!”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>As soon as the family and their guest crossed
the creek and reached the plateau they saw the light
of the bright new lamp.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pa’s come, our Pa’s come home for Christmas!”
shouted Henry Clay, joyously.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so excited, Henry Clay. You tend to
driving them dunkeys, or you will have Mis’ Clark
dumped off in the snow. That’d be a fine way to
treat a neighbor, wouldn’t it? You children quit
twisting round. If any of you fall off, you’ll have to
walk to the house.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, the children sat as still as they
could. Henry Clay tried to get the donkeys to hurry,
but donkeys have ways of their own. At last they
drew up before the door of the cabin. The children
would have rushed into the cabin, but their mother
restrained them.</p>

<p>“My goodness, children, where are your manners?
Pa’s made a fire; don’t you see the smoke?
You just behave yourselves.”</p>

<p>Once inside, the little group stood amazed. The
new lamp burned brightly; boxes, bundles and packages
were scattered everywhere about the place.
Grandma Clark, stiff with the cold, went at once to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
the stove. The fire burned merrily. She held her
hands to the grateful warmth, and said, “Your
man’s a right good provider, Mis’ Culberson.”</p>

<p>“But where’s Pa?” asked C’listie.</p>

<p>A thorough search revealed no Pa. On a new calendar,
which lay on the table, were scribbled these
words: “The gun is for the boy. The rest is for all
of you. Yours truly, Santy Claus.”</p>

<p>An hour later supper was over; even hungry little
C’listie could hold no more ham, and sat nodding
and hugging a wonderful doll. Henry Clay and Lizzie
Isabel had put the donkeys into the stable, and given
them an extra allowance of grain and carrots. With
shining eyes and heart too happy for words, Henry
Clay sat examining his treasure, the bright, new
gun. The girls were rapturously sorting their new
ribbons, hoods, and books. Mrs. Culberson, busy
storing yet unopened packages beneath the bed, said
to the girls:</p>

<p>“I <i>did</i> ’low for you girls to sleep under the blazin’-star
quilt, being it’s Christmas time, but I ain’t going
to let you. It ain’t never been used, and I’m
going to keep that quilt for Santa Claus. I’ll see
him some time.”</p>
